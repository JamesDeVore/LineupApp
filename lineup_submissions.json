I think neon garden is the best stage and where that genre belongs but can‚Äôt help but think they might do something similar to TL giving the respect to a big name like Carl Cox to play main stage.

I'm not taking credit for this, just sharing information for people who are new to EDC.\n\n\"EDC TIPS\n\nHotel:\n\n*pack an ice chest \n\n*cases of water\n\n*booze(buy this before you get to the strip, it's cheaper) ABC liquor stores or grocery stores are best. \n\n*solo cups and straws \n\n*cup o noodles(coffee makers are standard in most hotel rooms and will provide you with hot water) for those of you raving on a budget. I know it's not healthy but it's something and will help soothe your throat from inhaling dirt and ciggie smoke. \n\n*healthy snacks(bananas, oranges, beef jerky) pbj sandwiches are super easy, give you energy and don't need to be refrigerated. Eating is hard but make sure you do it!\n\n*emergen-c and other vitamins(tums, magnesium, 5htp, vitamin b) raveaid or any multi vitamin\n\n*melatonin or treesüò¨\n\n*portable speaker to play music while you get ready! If it's small enough, pack one in your purse or bag. it's great for waiting in line and grooving to music when everything is over. Everyone around me was grateful for tunes. \n\n*deck of cards(if you get bored and want to play drinking games or brush up on your card counting skills)\n\n*trashbags to keep your home away from home tidy(I can't stand a dirty hotel room and what will the maids think?!) Trash bags can also double up and become a makeshift ice chest. Just keep it in the bathtub and remember to empty it so it doesn't leak everywhere. \n\n*Sleep. You need it or you will become a crazy person. Trust me. \n\nTravel:\n\nI have driven, taken the shuttles and done taxi's. Hands down taxi's win. But keep in mind it's not financially ok if you have &gt;4 people.  Taxis had little to no wait time and was about $60 each way.  Taxis also have their very own lane once you get near the speedway. \n\n*Drive only if you know you have a safe sober driver but even tiredness gets you. Pack water/ gaterade and snacks in the car for the awful wait to get out of the parking lot. If you are driving drop a pin when you park so you can find your car later and aren't walking in circles around the speedway. It is vast. \n\n*The shuttles are great to experience the excitement and new people. Every year the shuttle system gets better and better but be prepared to wait. Plan on walking a ways if the shuttle stop is not near your hotel, or be lazy like me and head to a cab stand for the rest of the way home. 30 min was the fastest we arrived at the speedway(we left by 4:30pm) don't wait until 10pm to leave. head there early to avoid the ridiculous traffic. 100,000+ people trying to get to one place is very overwhelming. \n\n*DO NOT WAIT UNTIL AFTER 9-10pm TO LEAVE. You will be marinating in traffic. \n\n*buy a drink or fill up a water bottle or camelbak when leaving so you can have something to drink while waiting for a ride. That morning sun is no joke. \n \nFestival: \n\n*Hydrate\n\n*Arrive early for the first day! You have to see the festival grounds pristine at least once. It progressively gets grimier and grimier every day. \n\n*pick up your trash(they have a program where if you pick up and turn in x amount of water bottles/ trash you can score merchandise or even a trip to next years EDC! \n\n*savor the moment you step onto the stairs that lead you into paradise. You have an amazing view from the top! Just make sure you move out of the way of people trying to make their way into the festival grounds. \nThese are also the stairs you will curse when it's time to leave after dancing all night. \n\n*take breaks or your body will despise you the following day. Stretch while you're down there, it just feels good!\n\n*look to skies at midnight. You will see the most beautiful display of fireworks in your life. Take it all in hug a friend or a stranger and enjoy. It is ALL for YOUüí•\n\n*hand fan and spray bottle. Be someone's angel. Fan those around you that need it too! \n\n*For the love of your feet, wear comfy shoes. Comfort over fashion, all fucking day. Those heels might look cute but they won't feel cute in about an hour. \n\n*wear deodorant don't be the smelly kid in class.\n\n*bandana to protect your face holes from dirt and cigarette smoke(if you don't) also hides thizz face. ü§§\n\n*earplugs. It's so important to protect your ears. Tinnitus is no joke. \n\n*sunglasses for when the sun comes up( this is important) everyone arrives pretty but leaves ugly(dada life reference)\n\n*crotch it\n\n*KNOW YOUR RIGHTS \"Am I being detained?\" Is a phrase you need to be familiar with. Do not freak out and do not let officers bully you into admitting anything. \n\n*Establish a meet up spot immediately. Preferably something that can't be moved(NOT THE GIANT DAISY/Giant daisy fiasco of 2014) ours was a fire hydrant \n\n*hydrate\n\n*sneak some crystal light/Powerade/Gatorade packets to flavor your water too if you get bored easily. Plus electrolytes are good for you. \n\n*i don't like lemonade but everyone single one of my friends swear by it. \n\n*get fresh watermelon from the fruit stand. \nYou're welcome. \n\n*pick a side of a stage to be on. Our group would always meet to the right of each stages sound booth if we knew we were gonna see the same set and were separated. This worked every single time. \n\n*have a plan and let others know your plan but don't try too hard to stick to it. Follow your ears they know what they like(:\n\n*totems are great people finders, some people put amazing time and effort into them! Let them know!\n\n*Don't make it a priority to meet up throughout the night. YOU. WILL.  MISS. EVERYTHING. \n\n*save the days schedule on your phones lockscreen. Make sure to change it every day. It makes it so much easier to pull up instead of having to pull out the booklet every time. \n\n*Phone on airplane mode(service is real spotty) and you'll save precious battery power \n\n*portable charger if you can't bear to go off grid \n\n*time stamp your text messages ex: meet up at our spot at midnight(sent 8:50pm) text messages won't go through right away and you'll save yourself and your group from major confusion. \n\n*hydrate\n\n*take a couple of pics and video just don't overdo it. Trust me you'll never look at em again. And insomniac does a fantastic job at capturing everything. Live in the now and enjoy the spectacle that is real life! \n\n*explore, all of this is for you! Go on rides! They're all free! Go check out some live art, visit the art cars and side stages(artists will usually do a secret set there!) discover new artists, sit in cosmic meadow and talk to randoms...except the guy who is giving off the UnderCover vibe. He is one. Assume everyone is UC. Jk but seriously though be smart don't be a statistic. \n\n*eat and hydrate\n\n*if you plan on buying merch do it on the first day bc they do run out \n\n*cash\n\n*unopened gum, cigarettes and chapstick for three days. Security will make you toss anything that is unopened. \n\n*little unopened travel antibacterial wipes, baby wipes  and Kleenex. Those porta potties get real grossü§¢\n\n*tampons even if you aren't on yours, someone will surely need it. you maybe be someone's hero!\n\n*asian trains are a real thing. It sucks but if you're trying to leave a stage or go further into one hop on and they will get you where you need to go \n\n*when moving through crowds make sure to be courteous.  \n\n*your face will hurt from smiling so hard so don't let anyone ruin your time and don't bother with aggressive people. It's not worth it. \n\n*did I mention hydrate? \n\nAfter festival:\nThere are many day pool parties and events going on in Vegas during EDC week. If you plan on partaking be smart, drink water and take naps. Heat exhaustion and dehydration are all real. It is very possible to do EDC or any event sober as well! I have always chosen one day out of the weekend to do it. It reminds me that I love this music no matter what. #musicislife If you plan on partying remember rule number 1, Don't die. Rule number 2, you can always do more but you can't do less or take it back. So please be careful. There are medic tents everywhere. Have you ever experienced a hydrating iv?! It's glorious and free if you need it. They'll have bandaids and headache medicine and a cool place to rest if you feel overwhelmed. These people are not there to put you in jail, they just want you to be well. \n\nTake it all in and pace yourselves it's not a race it's a marathon. If you see someone in need or acting a fool don't pull out your phone and record them, help them. You wouldn't want to be that person. You are in a safe place, if you need help don't be too proud or afraid to ask. YOU WILL NOT get in trouble with the law.  Trade Kandi, make new, maybe lifelong friends. Reach out to someone who may be lost, you could make their night. Remember to take care of one another, be safe and be kind. ‚ù§Xoxo #queef__squad #azravefam\""},"ahnkoh":{"author":"DJwaynes","id":"ahnkoh","created_utc":1547915786,"num_comments":37,"score":1,"title":"EDC or Coachella?","selftext":"I've been to EDC twice now but haven't been the last couple years mainly because the house and techno (Neon Gardens) line-up hasn't been good enough for me to drop the $1000+ it takes to make the trip happen.

Parkway Drive, August Burns Red, A Day to Remember, Alesana, Blessthefall for those who were in a similar spot :P Anyway, I used to go to Wapred Tour and fell in love with festivals. I had friends who went to Lolla so I said I would tag along. The first years I usually stuck with them listening to the bigger bands and folk stuff they liked. But I always saw/heard Perry's in the background and wanted to investigate.\n\nI'll always remember my first time at Perry's at Lolla. It was SUPER small and Empire of the Sun was playing. Right away, I fell in love with the lights and the vibe. There was a dude with the light gloves and people with hula hoops and everythnig under the sun. It was like a hardcore concert in terms of pure emotion coming from people there. I definitely wanted to come back the next year. So, next year I came back for more and heard more genres. I think it was Bloody Beetroots, Skrillex, Pretty Lights, etc. (unless I skipped a year) and the dubstep really drew me in. Drops were so similar to breakdowns and it was so much damn fun. Every year after, more and more time spent at Perrys learning more and more artists and genres of electronic music. Saw Zedd at like 2 in the afternoon, Bassnectar blew my mind cause I had never heard of him, and Knife Party being one of the best shows I have ever seen. Saw Avicii (RIP), Justice, Deadmau5, and other huge DJs at main stages. The full spectrum. In recent years, Perry has become a little toxic in terms of crowd and I have moved to Spring Awakening as my festival of choice in the area.

Please just give info of 2018 shuttle experience since a new vendor took over, and past years won‚Äôt be fair to compare. \n\nI took Luxor premier 7pm and 6am time. I got to the shuttle line at 7, got patted down, walked into the bus, waited for people to board up to be able to head out. I would say it was like a five minute wait each day to head to the venue. So left at 7:05, typical 45-60 minute ride to the venue, except on Saturday when they had random military check on shuttles which added maybe 20-30 minutes of extra time. I left the venue after the last dj played, went to the Luxor premier spot, it looked shorter compared to the others. First night pretty much walked in the bus, 2 nd I missed the bus so waited like 5 minutes for the next bus to arrive to start boarding and get filled up to leave, so like 10-15 minutes. 3rd night was about the same, another 10-15 minute board up wait time. The drive back was the typical 45-60 minute drive back. I had friends who drove, left maybe an hour before the fest was over and I was pretty much back to my hotel before them and/or about the same time, except for Saturday cause they had to leave early cause one of my friends was tripping bad, so goes to show that shuttles work well in group settings cause you‚Äôre not forced to leave with your group. And if you‚Äôre in a group that drives, I think you can stay and take a standard shuttle back cause they don‚Äôt check passes for the way back I believe, if someone can confirm this please, that‚Äôs how it was previous years but not sure about last year. \n\nOverall, great experience with premiere shuttle at Luxor, I give it five stars 10/10.

I have more questions related to camping!**\n\nInsomniac put together their [camping guidelines](https://lasvegas.electricdaisycarnival.com/camp-edc/guidelines/) and [camping FAQ](https://lasvegas.electricdaisycarnival.com/camp-edc/faq/) pages related to camping and they are very informative. I'm not going to re-type all this information here, so use the links provided.\n\n**My wristband/parking pass/shuttle pass hasn't come yet!**\n\nBe patient, they are shipping out over 100k+ packages. You can also call Front Gate Tickets to see where your shipment is and/or set up will call pickup @ **888.512.7469**. Also here's the [Front Gate Tickets Support Site](http://support.frontgatetickets.com). \n\nIf you are coming from outside of the USA, you have no choice but to go to will call for your tickets. If you see no movement on your package and need to head to will call, here's that information (coming soon once it is released).\n\n**I have tickets/shuttle passes/parking passes to sell!**\n\nCheck out /r/EDCTickets or the [official ticket exchange](http://www.ticketsnow.com/seg134/resaleorder/edc-las-vegas-tickets/event/15481). Remember, even though our community is friendly, caring, and kind, there are ticket scammers out there that are willing to take advantage. \n\n**Tickets are still not sold out**, so you have to ask yourself if saving a few dollars is worth the chance of getting scammed! Be vigilant, if something seems to good to be true, it probably is. Trust your instincts.\n\n**Where can I register my Wristband? Do I have to register my wristband?**\n\n[You can register it here](http://insom.co/EDCLVwristband). The only way to recover your wristband if it is lost or stolen is to have it registered. Additionally, there is emergency contact information stored in your wristband as part of the registration process, if anything should happen to you. There is a $40 fee for a replacement wristband.\n\n**Well this is embarassing, I didn't listen to everyone and put my wristband on early/on the wrong hand, how can I get it off? I sold my wristband after I attended one of the nights, how can I get it off without damaging it?**\n\n[Here's a short how-to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcALJm9n5lA) to remove the wristband without damaging anything. **DON'T PUT YOUR WRISTBAND ON UNTIL FRIDAY BEFORE YOU LEAVE YOUR HOTEL!** It goes on your right wrist, and should be able to fit a finger underneath for breathing room.\n\n**I'm going solo to the fest, how can I make friends, I need a place to stay, etc.**\n\nThere are several ways of doing this. You can use the search function on the subreddit. There's also [some Facebook groups dedicated to solo journeys to EDC](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1528695257402603/). Once again, trust your instincts here and only stay with people that you can properly personally have vetted ahead of time. \n\nAlso, one of our mods made [this megathread post](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/7bv2il/roommatetentmatervmate_megathread_wanna_find/) for ride shares, hotel shares, and tent shares!\n\n**Live sets just aren't doing it for me, I need a feel for what this place is like before I attend!**\n\nCheck out [Under the Electric Sky on Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/70300667), or [The Electric Daisy Carnival Experience trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzSFZtRGeqs) from when the festival was still in L.A. If you can find The Electric Daisy Carnival Experience online for free somewhere or even for a couple bucks to stream it, I think it's a much better movie than the Under the Electric Sky movie.\n\n---\n\n##FAQ\n\n**When do the set times drop? When does the app update? I can't find the app on the app store, what gives?!**\n\nSet times and app updates usually happen the week of the festival. The Insomniac app will update soon, go ahead and install it now if you want to.\n\n**What about pool parties or other EDC Week events?**\n\n[Official site here](https://www.edcweek.com/) for a list of events and tickets. There's also going to be parties and pools at the campground.\n\n**What time should I leave the strip? How long does it take to get to/from to the speedway? What time should I leave the event to beat traffic?**\n\nEDC is not like a local DJ show and Las Vegas traffic SUCKS. Parking lots open at 2PM, so I would strive to leave the strip right around that time. Without traffic it will take you anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. The longer into the night you wait to leave the worse off traffic will be and the longer it will take to get to the show. I have heard nightmare scenarios of 2 or 3 hour shuttle rides, so don't let it happen to you!   \n   \nTypically, you can leave before the sunrise sets or about halfway through it and not have too bad of a wait in traffic back to the strip in the morning! At the end of night 3, keep in mind normal people are also heading to work since it will technically be Monday morning. That's just going to add to the clusterfuck of traffic on I-15 and Las Vegas Blvd. Plan accordingly! If you are driving have a cooler in the trunk with water bottles!\n\n**With all the terrorist attacks lately, what can I expect at EDC? Would it ever happen here, etc?**\n\nListen, the Speedway is right next door to a U.S. Air Force base and the event is 45 minutes into the desert and costs upwards of $400 to attend. That is a ton of work and a lot of hurdles for someone to go out there and do harm. Also, security will be checking that your wristbands are on before you are allowed into the lines to wait for the gates to open.   \n   \nThe Strip itself would be a better target if it were to even happen just due to the density of the crowd there. Expect a lot more cops than usual outside of the venue before you get inside! Don't let these people scare you from having a good time, that is the reason they are doing it, don't let them hinder our lives!\n\n**Do you know of any playlists that has all the artists music on it that are playing at EDC?**\n\n[For the past two years I've made Spotify playlists of the stages](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/68cu9i/edc_las_vegas_2017_artists_spotify_playlists_all/)! and I will do so again this year and post it whenever the 2018 lineup is dropped.\n\n**Are we doing the Reddit meetup again this year?**\n\nWe sure are. More information on the meetup coming soon.\n\n**What can I bring into the festival? What can't I bring into the festival? What are the searches like?**\n\nThe searches could be TSA style, or you could barely get touched at all. It's pretty random. Consider stash boxers or compression underwear to get your favors inside or items that are disallowed like LED gloves, etc. \n\nIf you take your time to observe the security, you can usually get a feel of who is being a hard-ass for a dime raise for busting someone and who is just doing their job quickly and efficiently.   \n   \nAs for allowed and disallowed items, [here's a link to those lists as well as totem guidelines.](https://lasvegas.electricdaisycarnival.com/guide/festival-guidelines/#acceptable-items)\n\nBring a gallon zip lock bag and put all of your belongings that you want to bring into the festival in it while you are waiting in line. All three days last year security complimented me on being organized and how easy I made their jobs because they could just scan the items in the bag, check my camelbak, give me the pat down and I was on my way. \n\nSeriously, if you make security's lives easier in this way, they will not hassle you at all as long as you aren't trying to bring in stuff that isn't allowed. I didn't even get pat down on Night 2 because I was so up-front about all my belongings.\n\n**Any further questions, feel free to comment below, or visit the [EDC Las Vegas Guide page](http://lasvegas.electricdaisycarnival.com/info/)!**\n\n---\n\n##Tips and Tricks!\n\n* Call your bank/credit card companies and let them know you will be traveling to Vegas to avoid holds on your account.\n* Be vigilant on the Strip. Everyone is trying to hustle. Street performers will expect tips if you take pictures!\n* Hit up a Vegas buffet at least one day.\n* Stretch beforehand in your hotel room. Your muscles will thank you in the morning!\n* Wear comfy shoes and/or get insoles to replace the \"stock\" insoles that come with your shoes. Also, consider moleskin if your feet are prone to blistering from rubbing against your socks. Your feet will thank you!\n* Get to the festival early. Stop by the merchandise tent first thing. Items sell out fast. Consider a mobile charging locker to store your merchandise in! Additionally, if you bring all of your sealed items in on the first day (wipes, chapstick, cigarettes, gum, tampons, etc), you can keep them all in your locker overnight and not have to worry about getting 3 of each sealed item to bring in every single day. **REMEMBER! Hide your lock from people that may peer over your shoulder or look at your combination wristband and try to get into your locker.** Remain vigilant inside the festival!\n* After you get your merch and put it in your locker, you next stop should be one of the four free water stands to fill up your hydration pack or water bottle. It's very important to remain hydrated, especially while the sun is still out and bearing down on you! If you tip some of the vendors, they will give you ice if the warm water turns you off.\n* If you need to eat something, consider the food trucks instead of the concession stand food. The food trucks have their company name out there and on the line when compared to the generic concession stand stuff, the quality of the food is unparalleled. Don't make the same mistake as I did last year and get a raw onion sandwich masked as a \"cheese steak\".\n* Bring earplugs! Tinnitus sucks!\n* Wear sunscreen! Remember, if you are staying all night the sun is up at like 5AM and starts beaming down on you almost immediately.\n* If you want to ride the rides, get there early or risk missing sets while standing in line! Some rides you will be waiting for an hour or more at peak times.\n* Time-stamp your texts! There will be cell service congestion. Stamping your texts will help your friends know whenever you truly sent a message!\n* Bring an external battery pack in with you to charge your phone if you are someone who likes to take a lot of photo and video!\n* Bring cash. Credit and debit cards could possibly be hit or miss if the speedway's internet network would happen to shit the bed! Don't be stuck without a way to pay for something you need!\n* Remember to take it easy night 1! EDC is a marathon not a sprint!\n* Emergen-C packets are a lifesaver. Take one before the festival every night in order to help you recover from the night before and prepare for the festival ahead!\n* Take some time to look up and enjoy the fireworks!\n* Don't forget about the EDC parade down Rainbow Road every night! You should at least try to check it out one time out of the three nights you are there!\n* Follow your favorite artists' social media so that you know if they may show up unannounced, or if they are doing any surprise sets on one of the art cars, etc.\n* Send a post card to back home at the EDC Town Post Office. Mine took until October to land, but it was a nice surprise when it finally did! Check out EDC Town in general. It's pretty sweet.\n* If you are feeling at all dehydrated or anything else medical related, visit one of the medical tents. Staff is super friendly and you WILL NOT get in trouble for seeking medical treatment, no matter your condition. If you can't make it to the medical tent, look for a Ground Control staff member to assist you or any of your friends! Look out for your fellow ravers. If you see something, say something! This will keep everyone safe and having a good time.\n* If you are going to do drugs, and especially MDMA, I suggest only doing it 1 out of the 3 nights and finding something else for the other two days. Just to let you know as an example of responsible use, in 2017 we did edibles and shatter the first night, rolled night 2, and just chilled with some shatter night 3. Everyone is different, but be safe, and TEST YOUR SHIT. Do not buy drugs at the festival. Not only do you risk getting bunk shit, but undercover cops are everywhere!\n* If you are going to drink alcohol, do so in moderation and stay hydrated! For every alcoholic drink you have, you should drink 8-16oz of water!\n* If you are a lady, bring wipes! Usually the porta-potties run out of toilet paper. It's just a fact of the festival and usually they don't get resupplied. You will thank me if you get caught in this situation.\n* Bring a hand fan for the water lines! They can get pretty hot and people will love you!\n* Try to catch at least one sunrise set one of the nights. I recommend night 2, since everyone and their mothers will be staying on night 3. Plus, Monday morning rush hour traffic on night 3 is no bueno.\n* If you have a large crew and need to split up to see different sets, plan a meeting spot! Try to pick something that is stationary, like the locker area, the cooling area, one of the buildings in EDC Town, etc.\n* Buy a smoothie or a lemonade. They are a nice change of pace from warm hydrant water.\n* Get a bandana and tie it around your neck for each night you are out there. Put it over your mouth and nose when the dust gets to be too much. Your lungs will thank you, plus you get to look like a bandit. Win/win.\n* Asian trains are going to happen, so use them to your advantage. Become the caboose to go into or out of the crowds and use your manners! Excuse me, thank you, etc go a long way when navigating the crowd!\n* Bring good vibes, leave the judgement at the gates, and most of all, enjoy yourself and smile! EDC is a glorious wonderland of fun. Extrude the vibes you with to receive back to you and you will have a great time, I promise!\n\n---\n\n##Let me know of any tip and tricks in the comments and I'll add them!"},"7rsj4q":{"author":"jquinones514","id":"7rsj4q","created_utc":1516477018,"num_comments":18,"score":0,"title":"Lineup","selftext":"WHEN TF IS THIS LINEUP COMING OUT"},"7s72so":{"author":"Mollywasmyfirst","id":"7s72so","created_utc":1516640027,"num_comments":24,"score":33,"title":"Stage lineup for EDC Mexico","selftext":""},"7s9m2h":{"author":"[deleted]","id":"7s9m2h","created_utc":1516660096,"num_comments":3,"score":5,"title":"UNOFFICIAL Bassnectar to headline EDC and lineup rumored to drop Valentines day","selftext":"[deleted]"},"7sa29i":{"author":"uvaairlines","id":"7sa29i","created_utc":1516663912,"num_comments":34,"score":13,"title":"Lineup Rumored for Valentine's Day?

Here's why I think this is true:\n\nSo Countdown released Deadmau5 and Porter Robinson as headliners well before the full lineup. I believe Bassnectar will be one of 3 headliners announced on Valentine's Day. Probably also Deadmau5 and someone else huge like Skrillex. (Don't quote me on that)\n\nThe main reason I think this is true is because Bassnectar was supposed to be the headliner of Middlelands every year and had a contract signed to come back multiple years. He announced it at Middlelands last May. But because there's no Middlelands this year (RIP pour some out) Bassnectar was moved by Insomniac to play EDC instead but he still wanted the headliner status (cuz you know it's Bassnectar) so they are gonna announce him early. \n\n\nTLDR: no Middlelands = Bassnectar at EDC + headliners early. \n\n\nEDIT: I also realize this isn't really anything new because the leak kinda said all this. I just wanted to give my own take on it.

It seems instead of going with the acts that EDC is most famous for and are bigger names they chose to go with much newer acts that have only been around for the last 2-3 years. I'm pretty heartbroken that Galantis, even though they have a month-long opening in their tour schedule that falls right on EDC, is not playing (they are my GF's favorite band ever). Also, Dillon Francis will **FREAKING BE IN LAS VEGAS DURING THE FESTIVAL** but I guess isn't going to play EDC (my favorite by far). I'm excited to see Grum (long time fan) and Diplo (a unique experience for sure), but BOY HOWDY WAS THAT REVEAL A LETDOWN. Even no brainers like Chainsmokers (not a fan, but they are hot right now), DJ Snake, and Flosstradamus are going to be in Las Vegas EITHER THE WEEK DIRECTLY BEFORE OR AFTER EDC and are not playing. (That, to me, is the most infuriating, and perhaps indicates that Insomniac TURNED DOWN or ignored a bunch of artists this year for some reason or another.)       \n        \n      \nSo, rant over I guess. I gotta find new artists to get into. I gotta make this $1,000+ trip worth it, right?

I dropped this on socials but wanted to swing by here. You guys do a great job on this sub, and some may like an explanation. Frustrating situation...but I‚Äôve laid it out the best I can below. Have a great time in 2018!\n\nI need to address the errant confirmation regarding EDC and Bassnectar‚Äôs supposed appearance at the festival in 2018, but correct information regarding the Valentine‚Äôs Day release date. I am not looking to pass blame, but I want to share the facts of how this occurred maliciously. \n\nFirstly, sources are constantly vetted here and the nearly 100% track record of correct information supports that. Secondly, it‚Äôs been determined without a doubt that incorrect, misinformation was passed down to Festive Owl purposely. As some may or may not know, leaks come from all kinds of places and sometimes directly from events, artist or representatives of the event themselves. This can happen for a myriad of reasons, but using it as a form to communicate indirectly with fans, build hype for lineup releases etc is usually a key part of it. I was reached out to by someone with knowledge of all of the above. They wanted to get information out there to build anticipation for the early Valentine‚Äôs Day release date (which proved to be correct), and also shared photos of the heart candies that would be mailed out to fans the day of including those with Bassnectar printed on them. They asked not to leak the photos, but please bring the info to the fans. Normally, this is a win-win situation. You get accurate information early, and it also helps insure The Festive Owl‚Äôs credibility stays at the level expected. Fast forward three weeks down the line ‚Äî the Valentine‚Äôs release date is officially announced, but Bassnectar doesn‚Äôt appear on the lineup. The ‚Äúsources‚Äù official email is deleted and others reach out to confirm that misinformation was pushed deliberately from a fake \"marketing firm‚Äù. Believe it or not, not everyone in the world of live music likes what goes on here. What can you do...\n\nFinally, know that I am not happy about this either. I take this very seriously and know others rely on accurate information to plan ahead and more. The Festive Owl was started as a source of festival news, rumors + more for the fans by the fans. That‚Äôs what it still is all these years later. Like with most things in life, this is no longer worth dwelling over. Systems will be revised to avoid a situation like this ever again. Keep being awesome. ‚Äî The Owl"},"7xttct":{"author":"justkate2","id":"7xttct","created_utc":1518730942,"num_comments":1,"score":1,"title":"Question about reserved premier shuttle times","selftext":"We weren‚Äôt planning on going to EDC this year but a lot of our favorites are on the lineup, so I guess we‚Äôre going! \n\nWe‚Äôve never used official shuttles before and the format on the premier shuttles is a little confusing for me. I see that they‚Äôre reserved times and the best ones are sold out. I also see that if you want to take a shuttle at a different time, you can attempt to ride a different timed premier shuttle on standby. Has anyone done this before? What‚Äôs the likelihood of getting on a standby shuttle at 7PM/6AM? Are there several buses per departure/arrival time? \n\nI see the other option is the ability to use the standard shuttles with the premier pass. How are the official standard shuttles in terms of wait times? \n\nI guess I‚Äôm just scratching my head at the reserved times. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve had a single year where we‚Äôve wanted to arrive and depart at the same time every night, it usually changes quite a bit year to year.

I don't even recognize a lot of the usernames anymore like I used to! But for all you new comers, I wanted to give my two cents(probably more lol) on how what EDc meant/means to me, and how it affected me after going.\n\nIn February 2015 I came across a lineup ad for some thing called \"EDC New York\" while I was sitting in my morning class for \"Love and Sex in the French Culture\" (college was a fun, strange time ;P). I was bored in class and was looking to see Bassnectar with my buddy sometime in the next few months, and saw he was playing at this festival, along with a ton of other DJs that I'd always wanted to see. I had never been to a music festival and had really only been into EDM since 2012, but this caught my eye. I start looking into it and realize the festival isn't far from our friends house in New Jersey.. Gears start going and next thing I know I'm texting my best friend, and the other mutual friend (who lives near Met Life stadium) to see if we could plan a fantasy trip to this festival. I research more and more and find that I apprarently had been living under a rock: EDC NY was a small festival compared to its parent, EDC LV...one of the biggest EDM festivals in the world. My friend and finally bite the bullet and get tickets for ourselves to go to eDC NY in May 2015. \n\nWe find out netflix has a documentary on this festival, and watch it to get us pumped for EDC NY, knowing that we could never go to the ACTUAL EDC LV, but enjoying the fact thatd we'd get a taste of it with EDC NY. Finally, after what seemed like forever, May came around and us Massachusetts boys headed for NYC to have our minds blown....and boy were they blown.\n\nFor two days I was at my first  music festival, and was in over my head in the most incredible way possible. The sets were amazing, the sights were indescribable, and the emotions felt became forever ingrained in my heart and memories. We finished the weekend and I immediately knew i needed more....i wanted the forbidden fruit. I wanted EDC Las Vegas!\n\nI gave it a few weeks to come back to reality, and finally texted my closest friends, most of whom were barely into EDM and hadn't even been to a rave/edm concert...and came up with this crazy idea: not 2015, and not even 2016, but in 2017 if we save for the next two years, the 5 of us can go to Las Vegas, and go to the biggest party we could ever dream of, and have one of the most incredible weeks of our lives!\n\nAside from the one who went to EDC NY with me, the guys were skeptical....still, I kept pushing them. Finally, by the end of the summer, the entire group decided (fuck it, let's do something crazy, and let's do it fucking RIGHT\". We would save for two years so we could be ballers that were way out of our element in LAs Vegas, but you wouldn't know it lookin at us! I frequented this sub every day for two years. Watched not one, but two EDC LV's (and all other EDC's!) go by while i anxiously waited for our time to come. \n\nAlong the way another friend joined to make our group 6. We had people in our group move to different states, had some of us drop out of college, some of us graduate, girlfriends changed, lives changed (a lot can happen in over two years!), but the thing that stayed the same was we all were going to EDC LV 2017. Finally June rolled around, and we were fucking READY. We had everything that could be planned planned to a T.\n\nWe stayed in a dope suite at the Venetian, and stayed from the Wednesday before EDC to the Tuesday after. We went to the Rehab pool party the Thursday before (absolutely amazing I cant recommend rehab enough!!! such a fun pregame!). We gambled, we partied, we had the time of our lives. EDC came and I made sure to give it absolutely everything i had for those three nights i had literally been waiting years for. It was different than I expected, but impacted me significantly nonetheless. There of course were speed bumps (some of us got along better than others, our airline lost our luggage from Wednesday to Friday morning, two of our Camelbaks broke on day 1, etc.) But it was still some of my most incredible memories in my life so far (I'm 23 now, 24 later this year).\n\nAfter EDC many of us went our separate ways for a while, which was expected....this was a bit of a last blow out bash for all of us together since some of us lived in different time zones by that point. I had a bit of a cathartic experience and shut myself away from this sub and didnt listen to any EDM for months, not because of a bad time but....after over two years of anticipation, followed by a release over a single weekend, you feel changed for a while.\n\nFinally by mid august I was coming back to normal again and leveled out. Of the six of us, only one is going back to this years EDC. I would like to go back in a couple years with my girlfriend. The experiences that were had at EDC changed me as a person, and helped me find myself a bit more. It made me finally come to acceptance with the next chapter in my life after graduating college only a month before.\n\nSome of you reading this will having similar experiences, some will have vastly different ones. But one thing I can say and give as advice to all you first timers: enjoy your time there, make every second count, because it does. Make sure you take time to realize where you are, in that moment, with all those thousands of others, sharing this one monumental experience together. Let yourself know that you deserve the reward you have all worked so hard for to be there, and know that somewhere down the line, well after the last stages have come down, and new stages may be going up, many of you will look back and say \"wow, those were some of the best memories of my life....\" Have fun all, and remember to make life count, under the electric sky &lt;3\n\n\ntl;dr: You're all wonderful, I wish you the best.

This year Friday only has 7 listed, Sat has 9, while sun has 8.\n\nI have a hunch at least two more artists will be annouced as late ads / special guests. One friday, which could be a relatively small artist as the lineup that day is already stacked.\n\nSunday is more way interesting though, I don't believe there is someone listed that has had the year to warrant the 1:30 Am headliner time slot. They could give it to Zedd because of Stay and The Middle but EDC has traditionally not rewarded commercial success to the point that they would make him the headliner of the whole festival. The stage he played and his set time at Escape from Wonderland would indicate to me that they don't think of Zedd as a headliner similar to the likes of DJ Snake, Calvin Harris, SHM, etc. (He did not play the mainstage, and he did not play last on the stage that he did play).... They could give it to Afrojack or Dash but thats even more unlikely.\n\nI think they have something special planned for Sunday the question is what it is - Another Night owl experience, Swedish House Mafia (EDC would have to wait until after Ultra to announce them most likely), or someone else entirely. \n\nThere are probably only 5 - 10 artists that could hold down that spot that aren't already on the lineup, but your guess is as good as mine. Who knows, maybe Zedd does get the spot after all. \n\nWhy do it like this: They have to keep up with Ultra which is going all out this year, they want to make a splash the first year of the festival being in May, and if they announce one or two big name artists about a month before the festival it will boost ticket sales. EDC did not sell out last year and I am sure they do not want to make that a pattern, this could be part of their solution.\n\nWhat does everyone think?\n"},"83hae7":{"author":"Reeder1700","id":"83hae7","created_utc":1520709485,"num_comments":13,"score":54,"title":"Full EDC Week lineup next week","selftext":""},"83j938":{"author":"Mourty1234","id":"83j938","created_utc":1520727851,"num_comments":0,"score":1,"title":"Anyone have an EDC 2016 Lineup shirt?","selftext":"So as the title alludes too, I am desperately looking for an EDC 20 (2016) line-up shirt in L or XL.

A lot of folks seem to be looking for recommendations, so this might be a good chance to give your own!  \n  \nI'm going to start with me... for obvious reasons.  \n  \nFirst, a little about me: I've been listening to electronic music since 1996. Before that, I listened to a lot of hip hop like A Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul and similar, which lead to scratching and breaks. I went to my first rave in 1998. Since then, I've been to dozens of real, actual raves, dozens of commercial style raves (like EDC both before it was in Vegas and the first time it went to Vegas, Beyond Wonderland, Escape From Wonderland, etc.), Coachella when it didn't totally fucking suck and had a lot more electronic music, other random festivals, countless club shows, The Love Parade (twice), and I'm probably forgetting more. Needless to say, I've been to tons and tons of shows, and I'm pretty old (at least, compared to most of you).  \n  \nAs I mentioned, I started mainly with scratching and break type stuff, then went into a trance phase, then I moved to Chicago so I got really into house (basically, forced into it if you know Chicago). All the while there was drum and bass kind of in the background.  \n  \nAround 1999 I started listening to a lot more jungle and drum and bass and that has basically consumed my musical preference since. I still like old trance and quite a bit of house, and I even appreciated some of the dubstep that was coming out in the mid 00's by Caspa, Skream, Rusko, and the gang (the first time I heard Caspa's remix of TC's \"Where's My Money\" I actually thought it was a joke track).  \n  \nI have a full DJing setup with production stuff and all that jazz. I have been mixing since I started fucking around with Traktor in 2003 without any physical equipment. I've never played a show. I obviously prefer to mix dnb, but can do pretty much anything at this point.   \n\nWithout further ado, here's what I am stoked about on the lineup by day. Some, INSANELY STOKED ABOUT despite having seen most of the DJs.  \n  \nFriday: Calyx &amp; Teebee B2B Break (holy shit), Pendulum, and Redlight. I'll also be interested to check out Dash Berlin, Flux Pavillion B2B Doctor P (please play old shit), and Kaskade (my girlfriends favorite).  \n  \nSaturday: Andy C, Green Velvet presents La La Land (my favorite techno guy), Loadstar B2B Mind Vortex, and Shimon B2B Benny L. I'd like to check out Andrew Bayer, Digweed, and Tiesto.\n \nSunday: Caspa, DJ Hype B2B Hazard (my favorite DJ who runs my favorite label B2B with my favorite producer... HOLY SHIT), Drumsound &amp; Bassline Smith, Ferry Corsten (my favorite trance guy), Paul Van Dyk, The Prototypes B2B TC, and Tantrum Desire. I'd like to check out ATB, Boys Noize, Cosmic Gate, Dash Berlin (again? whoa), and Loco Dice.  \n  \nLet me know if you guys have any suggestions for things I should check out! I am obviously into darker stuff these days, and tend to go towards techno rather than house and trance. Don't be shy!  \n  \nAnd post your own lists, because I want to see what ya'll are excited for! Party time, woo!  \n\nI don't know if this has been done already. Searching is difficult.

(With the exception of my 1st EDC experience for obvious reasons)\n\nI remember coming back from my first EDC with crazy withdrawals and I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it for months. I was excited for the following two years and it was a great time, but I never really missed it like I did the very first time. However coming back home now, I‚Äôm feeling like that again. Like I‚Äôm just thinking of all the good memories, people we met, just everything. I‚Äôm telling myself just yesterday I was at EDC. Crazy I‚Äôm back home.\n\nIt was just me, my girlfriend and a cool group of people we met on the last day. I usually always went with a group of 10 people and even more sometimes so this was a complete change. I felt like the lineup was good, but not great in comparison to the previous years, however, was completely eclipsed with the fact that how good and consistent most of the sets were. This was also the first time I went to Vegas as a 21 year old who booked his very own hotel himself and bought plenty of drinks to flash my expired drivers license haha. Nobody cared! I went to my first EDC Vegas as soon as I graduated high school back in 2015 and haven‚Äôt missed a year yet for reference\n\nI didn‚Äôt even want to go at all this year because of how much money I would have to spend, but my girlfriend really wanted to because this was her second time. We went last year together with a big group, but we didn‚Äôt really know each other. We started dating soon after we got back haha. So this trip was kind of like a special one year anniversary, well if it were in June, but close enough. The weather was definitely worth having it in May. However, I am not sure if I will go again next year just because I feel more than satisfied with the times I have went and would rather use that money for other endeavors. Who knows, I‚Äôve been saying that the past couple years\n\nI just had to get this off my chest because I can‚Äôt stop thinking about the past weekend. I don‚Äôt usually feel this emotional often.

COME WITH US ON OUR PRIVATE VIP SHUTTLE! We will get you to the Las Vegas Motor Speedway each day and get you back to your hotel in the morning without the long wait!","selftext":"Come with us, only 8 weeks until EDC LAS VEGAS 2018!\n\nHere is the rundown on how we operate our private VIP shuttle service. My 2 friends and I run 3 brand new 15 person shuttle vans every EDC LV, this will be our 8th year operating.\n\nWe leave the strip to drop people off at the Speedway at approximately 5PM, 6PM, 7PM, 8PM, and 9PM and the returning trips are at approximately 2AM, 3AM, 4AM, 5AM, 6AM and our last shuttles leaves the speedway around 7AM or so. If you are pre booked with us then you are guaranteed a ride! Those times are approximate but since we have 3 15 passenger vans we have some leeway with times and getting everyone there and back when they want. Our base is at The Cosmopolitan this year so we try to have as many people as we can meet up with us there if they are staying nearby and then we make 2 or 3 other stops to pick up people. We also do pickups/dropoffs downtown or off the strip as long as it's close to the strip and not in Summerlin.\n\nOn the way back we drop everyone off at their individual hotels since everyone is tired and just wants to get back to their hotel ASAP. We charge $25 per person each way, ($150 for round trip service all 3 days) if we bring you to the speedway from the strip then you are guaranteed a ride back with us as long as the ride back is paid for when we meet up to take you to EDC.\n\nWe don't offer just rides back to the strip from EDC, we offer ROUND TRIP SERVICE ONLY (unless another arrangement is worked out) and we DO NOT pick up random people at taxi stands and in front of hotels.\n\nWe started pre booking and reservations about 2 months ago and as of now we are about 50% booked so we only have a limited number of seats/spots left. We take a deposit to guarantee and hold your seat thru Google Pay, Zelle, Facebook or Wells Fargo and then you can pay us the balance the first day we pick you up to go to the speedway. This year will be our 8th year running our EDC Las Vegas shuttles.\n\nMost of the people that come with us are repeat riders from previous years, friends of ours and friends of friends and fellow Redditors. Last year and in years past we transported a lot of Redditors and a lot of them are coming with us again this year. \n\nWith us there is no waiting around for hours in lines to catch a shuttle to get to the speedway or hours and hours of waiting in shuttle lines to get back to your hotel after EDC and unlike the official shuttles where you must take it from a specific hotel and back to the same hotel we will pick you up at whichever hotel you want and take you back to what ever hotel you want to go to. Did I mention that there is no waiting for hours for us to take you back to your hotel in the morning after EDC is over for the night! We consider ourselves an express shuttle VIP service since we pre book everyone and you know your pickup times in advance and don't have to stand around for hours and hours waiting in line to get on a shuttle. If you decide you want to leave earlier then planned just text me or one of my other 2 drivers and you can hop on an earlier shuttle, we're pretty lenient in that regard, our main goal is to make sure everyone gets to and from the LV Motor Speedway in a safe and fun manner and that everyone makes it home safe and in a timely manner in the morning.\n\nWe blast EDM the whole way there to get everyone in the mood for the night, you can drink on our shuttles and we provide unlimited free ice cold bottles of water for everyone there and back. You can also meet new people on our shuttle and join their group if you hit it off. \nWe also have phone chargers and portable chargers on board in case anyone wants to get a quick charge in during the trip. It is a really fun trip for everyone that rides with us!\n\nIf anyone wants to reserve a seat/s for themselves or their group or has any questions whatsoever please post in this thread or message me any questions you have and I'll get you all set up with us.\n\nWe have plenty of references and a Facebook event page that you can join if you decide to come with us.\n\nThanks guys and we look forward to meeting you and driving you to EDC!\n\nSorry this is so long but I really wanted to spell out how our service works."},"86gyso":{"author":"Chakg1","id":"86gyso","created_utc":1521768661,"num_comments":0,"score":2,"title":"Any Djs on line up like Ship Wrek ?","selftext":"I was hoping Ship Wrek would be on the line up...But since not any other Djs wit the same style ?"},"88v25z":{"author":"patwilliam","id":"88v25z","created_utc":1522626045,"num_comments":6,"score":6,"title":"Anyone staying at the Rio?","selftext":"Looking to meet up with some people to take the shuttle with on the first night.

Just a little background info on me:\n\nI moved to Japan 2 and half years ago to start a new life in this crazy city. I come from California, Bay Area! I decided I wanted to quit my job working at google and wanted to travel the world, but not only did I want to travel, I wanted to meet people and help them out with anything related to travels and cultural understanding. \n\nLast year, I started to work as an airbnb experience host(tours) that host nightlife experiences in Tokyo! So this past year, I started my own little business in Japan via Social media called Livguide, a place to get information right away from actual locals! \n\nI also speak Spanish, and Japanese!\n\nSo this year, I wanted to organize a bar hopping get together for anyone coming to Japan this year for EDC Japan! Even if you don‚Äôt drink, you should still come out and hang out with me! I love taking people around the local hidden areas and you‚Äôll get first hand experience with locals!\n\nIf you use instagram, just follow me on my business page:Livguide. It‚Äôs the same for facebook in case you don‚Äôt use instagram. And if you don‚Äôt use neither, you can message me on here or on line app: Afcastillo64.\n\nI hope you guys find this info useful, and would love to meet you all before, during, or after edc japan!

Looking for all of your input.\n\nThis is going to be my 5th EDC.  Super looking forward to seeing the fam again.\n\nI have always taken the shuttle.  The second year I took the juscollege shuttle and that was amazeballs.  I have never driven.  My friend and I both bought shuttle passes for mid strip, its sold out now, we are staying at Bally's.  We were thinking about getting a rental car instead.  For the most part we would be okay to drive.  I generally don't like to pregame at the hotel only to sit on the bus for two hours.  One of us would be sober on the way back.  We are both over 25 so that's not a factor either.\n\nThis is what I am thinking about as far as $$ is concerned.  We both paid $120 or so for the shuttle passes that I'm pretty sure we would be able to sell for face value.  I have a reservation for a SUV rental car for $150 for the weekend.  That price is all in with insurance and what not.  Obviously that doesn't include gas.  I'm also considering that if we didn't rent a car we would have to Uber or taxi from the airport and back which is about $20 both ways.  I know that our hotel charges for parking now.  Hopefully we could get it comped.  I like the convenience of being able to drive to a grocery store and pick up supplies and find a weed store off the strip.\n\nConvenience wise, I liked last year that you went through security while waiting at the shuttle stop.  We probably plan to leave for the speedway around 6 everyday and stay till about 4am, unless there is a killer sunrise set I can't miss.  I'm not sure what is better waiting before getting on the shuttle or at the speedway.  I like the idea of not having to wait in line for a shuttle at the end of the night even if the lines aren't too bad at 4am.  I'm hopeful for this new company doing the shuttles.  \n\nLet me know what u guys think.

Left with only the RV pass to get the benefits exclusive to EDC campers.\n\nAs I began to think about it, there were even more benefits to RV camping over the tent option:\n+much more space (28' x 8'6\" rectangle versus 12.5' x 12.5' circle)\n+ A more secure space (solid vehicle vs tent, door locks vs small travel locks)\n+ dedicated 3 burner propane stove top &amp; microwave vs rental portable stove (68L vs 3L)\n+ fridge &amp; freezer vs cooler (ice refills, price TBD)\n+ dedicated shower with both hot &amp; cold water vs public showers that thousands of people will use and will have to line up for (1hr+ during peak hours)\n+a generator to power appliances\n\nSo we have the RV pass (up to 8 people), and RV that sleeps 5 on beds (and potentially 2-3 more on the floor if everyone is comfortable with that).\n\nWe are planning to arrive on Friday around noon at the EDC grounds with the RV ready and we will be leaving Monday morning around 10am.\n\nCost is $300 per person (same price as a spot in a moonglow tent).\n\nWe are carpooling from LA early Friday morning.\n\nLet us know if you're interested in joining us for an awesome EDC weekend. \nIf you have any questions, ask away."},"8h10xz":{"author":"malec321","id":"8h10xz","created_utc":1525455090,"num_comments":15,"score":2,"title":"Encore Beach Sunday..

Here are tips I don't think I have ever seen, which could carry over to all festivals honestly.\n\nArrive early - Don't leave your hotel when gates open, arrive early so you are not rushing, you can relax, you can pregame a bit in the car, and then you can slowly walk to the line to get inside. You paid over 400 dollars for just the ticket, don't sell yourself short by arriving 4 hours late. \n\nWatch out for your friends - People steal all over EDC, just because a majority of the people are good kind hearted people, be aware there are people who go to events like this to solely steal from overs.\n\nthis is YOUR EVENT - Even if you came with friends realize not everyone likes the same music or has the same preferences. As I stated earlier, you paid over 400 dollars to attend, go where you want and meet up later, I promise you, you will not regret it.\n\nExplore - EDC is incredible, take time early one of the days before anyone you must see begins playing. EDC has so many fun art installations, art cars, and relaxation areas. I always make it a point to simply walk around EDC and enjoy the scenery.\n\nBring the vibes - If you are looking for good vibes the first person who needs to bring them is yourself. So be happy, let loose, be yourself, smile, and care for people beyond your own self. \n\nI hope this helps, have a wonderful EDC everyone. \n\n\nP.S.

We have had the worst exegetical with American Airlines i have ever even heard about in my life. Basically when our flight got cancelled the people behind the counter saw how angry we all got since we had been waiting there for 5 hours and the turned their backs and left. Said nothing to anyone and just left. Who the fuck does that. I know I‚Äôm in Miami and i know how bad customer service is here but fuck that was bad.  So after waiting about 10 minutes some lady came out and basically told us to fuck off and go rebook that we were fucked, also she didn‚Äôt mention that our plane mysteriously left to NY (i know this because my dad works at the airport here). So after that the airport was complete chaos. Lines for rebooking were about 3 hours long. America airliners hold time was about 1 hour and some how we all ended up at a gate for a Vegas flight leaving at 11pm. We got on the standby there and mind you when we got in the standby we were number 9 on the list but for some reason the more people that would get on the standby list caused our number to soon turn into 30(asked the lady at the counter how it is possible for our number to go down on the list and not up that just didn‚Äôt make sense to me). So anyways they end up picking 3 lucky passengers to board that plane and on the actual standby list their numbers were 8,24,43. Don‚Äôt ask me how that happened because not even their own workers could tell you why. After that we were forced to stand in line at rebooking a very nice young lady by the name of Janet assisted us and got us on Standby for a 8:45am flight and confirmed us to leave to vegas at 9:15pm if the standby does not work. I will be completely honest with you guys this has been THE WORST EXPERIENCE I HAVE HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE! Not even breaking my left arm and 3 ribs in one day can come close to how shitty this experience made me feel. I could just see it in everyones eyes who had gotten fucked like us that they just wanted to cry. OH WAIT SIDE STORY: while waiting to get on that 11:00pm flight there was a gentleman who was already late for his wedding and we all agreed he should have one of the standby spot and the lady on the counter said ‚Äúits whatever we decide‚Äù Hope he made it to the wedding.

(I bet this is fun but im to much of a germaphobe)\n\nGiant Jenga, pool table, ping-pong, Connect Four, chess and more (so bar games, i guess if you want to take a break, but $700 to play ping pong)\n\nInteractive EDC VIP photo op located at kineticFIELD, circuitGROUNDS and cosmicMEADOW (this was cool and was enjoyed)\n\nDedicated, expedited VIP festival entry (didnt get this at gate S)\n\nCustom commemorative VIP show lanyard (didnt get this at gate S)\n\nAir-conditioned bathrooms located at kineticFIELD, circuitGROUNDS and neonGARDEN (standard)\n\nFully stocked bars offering signature EDC cocktails (the lines wern't as long as in GA)\n\nCell phone charging stations at kineticFIELD, circuitGROUNDS and neonGARDEN (admittedly I didn't see these)\n\nSo in conclusion, I would get VIP again if i was coming from overseas as they offer some ways to get into festival mode with kandi making and body paint.\n\nComing from the US I would not get VIP for edc again. There was nothing about it that made me go, VIP was worth it as I have in the past. \n\nMy main problem was entrance into the festival. I can go through GA parking and waiting in hour and a half line, then get VIP entry.\n\nOr go through premier parking and then wait with everyone else (why'd I spend $700 again?)\n\nThe icing on the cake was how far the vip standing sections were from the stages."},"8lcsjj":{"author":"LA_Drone_415","id":"8lcsjj","created_utc":1527017064,"num_comments":72,"score":133,"title":"Camp EDC - Final Thoughts","selftext":"I'm sure plenty of non-campers are curious to know how the first year of camping went, so I thought I'd share my experience.  \n  \nCHECK-IN  \nSo as most of you probably have heard by now, check-in on Thursday afternoon was a clusterfuck. BUT I may have had one of the better experiences out of most people. We got in the back of the line at around 6:30 PM. After checking the Reddit threads and not moving for about 20 minutes, we decided, fuck it, we're going back to the strip! We had a few drinks (not our DD, obviously) and gambled for a bit. At around 12:30 AM, we headed back to the speedway and entered through gate 8. It took about 30 minutes to reach the first set of tents, and another 45 minutes to reach the security check. In total, it took about 1.5 hrs to go from exiting the speedway, to reaching our tent. I feel bad for everyone that waited so long in line, when it went so smoothly for us!  \n    \n  \n  \n\nSHIFTPODS  \nThe shiftpods were beautiful. Plenty of space for 4 people, sleeping bags, gear, and a cooler. I used an eyemask to sleep, but even without it, the tent was plenty dark to sleep in during the day. I just put my sleeping bag directly on the artificial grass, and it was comfortable. The grass was soft and clean. Now for the bad: when the AC was working, it was FREEZING in the tent, BUT- the AC was not always working. In the day when everyone was using it, it would either cut out completely for 10-20 minutes, or just blow hot air. Luckily this year, because of the time of year, it wasn't as hot as EDC usually is. But it was definitely uncomfortable. It didn't bother us as much because we left in the day to use the pool or partake in other camp activities, but man. In my opinion, the AC should've been Insomniac's #1 priority, not just for comfort, but because of safety. How can they not prepare for everyone having AC on at the same time? If there was one thing I could pick for Insomniac to work on, it's this. Ensure everyone has working AC at all times, and dedicate a ton of resources to be ready to fix it ASAP as soon as it goes out.  \n  \n  \nTHE MESA  \nThe campgrounds were awesome. We spent every afternoon at the pool party, and it was one of the highlights of camping. Cooling off in the water while drinking a beer, dancing our asses off, and meeting other groups was so much fun. While my fiancee did yoga in one of the tents, I laid in the grass in the same tent underneath the misters. Fell asleep immediately.  The food options were decent (but expensive).  However, since we were able to bring our own food I actually saved money in the long run. My total money spent was way less than last EDC.     \n  \nBATHROOMS/SHOWERS  \nI never had problems finding a bathroom to use without waiting in line, BUT some bathrooms were definitely better than others. The porta-potties I usually walked straight in, but they were straight up disgusting. Close your eyes and hold your breath. The nicer bathrooms sometimes had a line, and on the first day most of them were actually closed for maintenance. The showers had lines most of the time, and the length varied based on the time of day. I usually went as soon as I woke up around 2pm, and the longest I had to wait was about 15 minutes. The longest line I saw was around 6pm as people were getting ready to go to the festival, and it looked around 30-40 guys in line.  It would've been nicer to have more 'nice' bathrooms and more showers, but honestly I've been camping so much, including other music festivals, and it was no worse than the other times.   \n  \n***My suggestion for Insomniac: have outdoor shower heads across the campsite for people to use. I would say MOST people, including myself, would have been fine just showering quickly in their bathing suit outside without the need for a private stall. This would've sped things up greatly.*** \n    \n  \nCONVENIENCE  \n  \nNow the best part for me: the convenience. Last year I said I was done with EDC because of the damn struggle to get to and from the strip every day. This eliminated all of that. I was able to sleep in, get some food, party at the campgrounds, change, nap again, and STILL show up to EDC early for the opening sets. Then at the end of the day, I could stay until the very last set, after sunrise, and be back to my tent in less than 30 minutes. Compare that to last year when I start getting ready to leave at 2pm, line up for the shuttle at 4pm, and maybe make it to the campground by 6:30. Then at the end of the day, leave the festival at 5:30 am, suffer in line for two hours, and make it back to my hotel by 8:00 am. \n  \nConfession: I'm getting older. On Friday, my fiancee and I could not hang. At 10:30pm, we realized we would not last the entire night, so we decided to walk back to camp. We went back to our tent, passed out for 2 hours, and went back to the festival completely refreshed. It made all the different in the world. We were recharged and went hard until sunrise. The camp already saved us on the first night.   \n  \n  \nIn my mind, all of the negative things about the camp are worth it for this convenience alone. I really felt like I got my money's worth this year because we could maximize our time at the festival, and go back to camp so easily.     \n\n  \n  \nTRAVEL TIME  \n  \nGoing TO the festival took much longer than leaving, just because of the security line. To give everyone an idea, I timed my commute to and from the festival every day. Note, since we arrived late Thursday, I was in the very back of the campgrounds, so one of the longer commutes.  \nFRIDAY:  \nTo EDC (5:30 PM): 41 minutes  \nTo tent (5:40 AM): 19 minutes   \nSATURDAY:  \nTo EDC (7:45 PM): 46 minutes  \nTo tent (5:15 AM): 15 minutes   \nSUNDAY:  \nTo EDC (8:30 PM): 32 minutes  \nTo tent (3:45 AM): 15 minutes   \n  \n\n    \n  \n  \n\nTL;DR: Yes there are things Insomniac can improve on. But this might have been my favorite EDC yet, largely in part because of Camp EDC, and would 110% do it again.\n"},"8lg0mb":{"author":"camelliaxsin","id":"8lg0mb","created_utc":1527044108,"num_comments":20,"score":6,"title":"Das Energi","selftext":"Anyone in this group headed to Das Energi this August in Utah?

That place was packed for them!! The whole set was great, started slow but picked up. After they ended, the place cleared out and someone started playing really good music right away. I ended up staying and half an hour later I find out from some guy next to me that it's Boys Noize!! \n\nThe guy who told me it was Boys Noize was awesome, he also had left his friends for the Cosmic Meadow and told them he'd be hanging there for three hours cause of the line up! A-Trak still had to come one! After seeing Tchami and Malaa and listening to Boys Noize, I was having sooo much fun and just vibing with myself and everyone around me since I was solo. I felt like the vibes were sooo good there all night because I just kept meeting people. Even got a light show from some guy who was behind me giving some girl one! While he was giving me the best one of my life, another girl Glover came up behind him and started going in too!! It was amazing. Everyone around me just kept connecting over and over and I loved it! After they finished I thanked them and proceeded to rage to Boys Noize.\n\n After that set finished, A-Trak came on and continued to kill it! Sooo many awesome people showed up for that set as well. As I was dancing by myself, and smiling and vibing with everyone around me, people kept coming up to me and giving me kandi! I'm not a Kandi maker so I felt bad when they wanted to give me one but they didn't care! Just wanted to spread the love, and give me one and it was beautiful. I appreciated everyone so much. I met people from Australia, Michigan, California, Arizona!!  There was literally sooo much love all night. I danced with so many different faces and awesome people. A-Trak was playing so many good songs also and his scratching skills were on point. There were some parts where he was scratching for 20-30 seconds! The visuals for all three sets were just amazing as well. I was in awe and excitement the whole time I was there. Anyways, I just wanted to share my favorite story of Sunday night.

Your outfits are better. Your shoes are better. You now want to catch twice as many shows as you did year one. You now feel like you got more out of it than you did the first time.\n\n*Year 3- There are now triple the amount of DJs you want to see and you need to make Excel spreadsheets on how you are going to time everything and who are the most important artists you want to see. You have been making kandi and planning your outfits for months because EDC is not just a two time thing anymore you realize it is your life. Your new favorite movie line is \"I wake up to EDM, I go to sleep to EDM, Dusk til Dawn, EDM\"\n\n*Year 4- There are more DJs you want to see than physically possible and you have cut your list down to extreme measures. You constantly livestream shows, listen to Night Owl Radio every week, and make alllll your own Spotify playlists, have a Soundcloud account and do legit RESEARCH on who tf you want to see. You get angry at Pasquale for making you choose between Eric Prydz, Tchami x Malaa, and Zedd bc WTF was that Pasquale?!

My 2 friends and I had VIP so everyone who was already in the GA line (probably for awhile... sorry guys but it was my bday and I treated myself to VIP!) already had a partner and then there was no one in the VIP line besides us. My friends rode the ride without me and I literally couldn't find anyone to ride with me for awhile. Then some chick out of nowhere offered me her man. She said \"Here ride with him\" and grabs her guy friend and moves him right next me. I really appreciate you guys doing that for me. I was super hurt by my friends.

But I like to leave it a surprise. I want people to have that ‚Äòwow‚Äô moment when they walk in.‚Äù\n\nRotella does reveal the concept of the stage in question, which will be themed around Gaia, the goddess of the Earth in Greek mythology.\n\nMany more new developments are planned for EDC 2017, including an added stage that will cater to a specific, yet-to-be-revealed style of music.\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a genre of music that‚Äôs really grown a lot in the States in the past couple of years and we‚Äôre going to build a whole new stage,‚Äù the 42-year-old Rotella says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre moving some stages around, and that‚Äôs going to add some extra flavor to the experience as well. I want it to be a different place every year. We get a lot of people who‚Äôve been coming for 10 years plus, and in order to keep their interest, we really have to change things up a lot.‚Äù\n\nIn addition to the extra stage and altered footprint for the fest, Rotella says that this year‚Äôs EDC will also feature an influx of artists who will be new to the event, which came to Vegas in 2011 after debuting in the L.A.-area in the early ‚Äô90s and now features well over 100 performers each time out.\n\n‚ÄúWe have artists that we‚Äôve never, never had before,‚Äù he says of the lineup, which has traditionally been announced in the late spring.\n\n‚ÄúThe music is 99 percent done,‚Äù Rotella adds. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre further along on a lineup than we‚Äôve ever been this far in advance.‚Äù\n\nAttendance-wise, EDC has grown every year, drawing a high of more than 400,000 fans in 2016, which Rotella says will be the ceiling for now.\n\n‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt add more capacity, even though we do have the room on site per fire code and all that kind of stuff; it‚Äôs the in-and-out that I wouldn‚Äôt want to put more pressure on,‚Äù he explains.\n\n \nWith the festival growing to the extent that it has, might EDC someday pull a Coachella and expand to two consecutive weekends?\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve thought about it,‚Äù Rotella says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve considered lowering the capacity to do two weekends, to alleviate some of the traffic challenges. I‚Äôve also considered keeping it on one weekend but changing the time of year so that we can do camping, kind of like they do at NASCAR, so that there‚Äôs not this influx each night. It‚Äôs been considered.‚Äù\n\nRotella recalls some wariness among local officials when he first began planning to bring EDC here. Now, Vegas is synonymous with EDM culture, from EDC to the Strip, where just about all the big-name DJs have a residency.\n\nAlong the way, EDC has become an international brand, expanding to Brazil, India, Mexico and the U.K., with its Japanese debut scheduled for April.\n\nThe Vegas event, though, remains the EDC flagship, the party of all parties.\n\n‚ÄúVegas is Insomniac‚Äôs New Year‚Äôs Eve,‚Äù Rotella says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what sparked everything that‚Äôs going on now for dance music. EDC Las Vegas has been in the middle of all that. It‚Äôs home.‚Äù\n\n"},"5qq8t5":{"author":"Ben_der_hover","id":"5qq8t5","created_utc":1485641424,"num_comments":70,"score":7,"title":"Edc lineup speculation (with info from Pasquale's interview)","selftext":"Just wanted to have a fun discussion about who you think Pasquale was talking about in his interview about edc 2017.

Also it seems like they cut down the number of progressive and electro house acts last year and I hope they bring some of them back for 2017."},"5vhbof":{"author":"conker1264","id":"5vhbof","created_utc":1487747632,"num_comments":3,"score":7,"title":"Omnia Lineup released"},"5vlq48":{"author":"uncreative_raver","id":"5vlq48","created_utc":1487800654,"num_comments":15,"score":8,"title":"Hakkasan announces eDC Weekend Lineup"},"5vm9fn":{"author":"conker1264","id":"5vm9fn","created_utc":1487805776,"num_comments":61,"score":31,"title":"Wet Republic lineup announced"},"5w3prr":{"author":"midnight_h0ur","id":"5w3prr","created_utc":1488022795,"num_comments":22,"score":4,"title":"Random Question about lineup","selftext":"Hey there!

He attended back in 2015 or 2014 (or both can't remember) but i know for sure he wasn't there last year. I know he has a residency at Hakkasan nightclub and he even has a show on the night of the 17th. But I'll be at the actual event so I wouldn't be able to go unless i maybe dipped and went to hakkasan instead. I've seen a lot of my favourite DJ's so far (Marshmello, Tchami, Zed etc) but Calvin Harris initially got me into EDM so it's been a dream of mine to see him live at a Club or an event.

I went to EDC in 2013, but haven't gone back since.\n\nWhen I went in 2013 I booked a shuttle pass, hotel, and scored tickets on craiglist at face value (in phx) a few weeks before the event.\n\nWe really want to see the lineup first. Been raving for 6 years and don't really want to go if the lineup consists of people we've seen multiple times. Based on last years lineup, thats not the case, but coachellas was so bad this year I can only anticipate the worse.\n\nI know the shuttles are essential. I see they are selling out. So first question is, if I just buy the passes, are they as easy to sell as the tickets??\n\nSecondly, when I went in 2013 the crowd was very pleasant. I felt like people there knew what they were doing and were respectful. I felt that was at coachella 2013 too. Coachella 2017 the crowd consists of kids in high school and freshmen in college who don't know the difference between bath salts and mdma, and end up eating grass like their a god damn cow (true story). \n\nHow is the crowd at edc now adays? Are you consistently getting shoved and pushed? Are people respectful? Are people the majority of the people there only there to say they went?\n\nAny insight on people who went a few years ago vs today would be greatly appreciated!!"},"66m554":{"author":"CAT2K17","id":"66m554","created_utc":1492737782,"num_comments":2,"score":28,"title":"EDC LV 2017 Lineup Reveal Mega Mix!

The new logo is noticeably simpler than the old one. It is a lot more neutral and doesn't make room for any assumptions about what sort of festival EDC is. What I think this means? BIG changes to a lot of things that may or may not include:\n\n\n**1)The lineup:** EDM is subsiding in popularity. Two years ago a lot of pop radio was EDM-infused. Think Zedd's 'True Colors' album and Calvin Harris' work from 'Motion'. Now EDM artists are moving towards the indie pop sound that hardly incorporates any elements of \"EDM\". Paris by The Chainsmokers is a great example of what the scene is moving towards. So expect EDC to cater the lineup towards fans of other genres like rap and rock.\n\n\n**2) The look of the festival:** I think with the explosion of EDM came a lot of money being poured into event companies like Insomniac, Ultra, and ID&T. With this sudden influx of budget came these massive, over the top festivals like EDC and Tomorrowland. I think with event sales being lower recently, spending room for EDC is gonna be lower. Expect a more \"back to basics\" sort of approach. No more neon everywhere, less crazy art installations, smaller Kinetic Field stage from now on. However, I'm sure Pasquale will still find a way to make it look magical as hell. After all, this is EDC, the Holy Mecca of American raving we're talking about here.\n\n\n**3) The experience:** This is more just the general vibe of the event that I am referring to. I expect the PLUR/kandi trading type people to have less of a presence at future EDC's. I imagine attendees will soon be more similar to the people attending Coachella or HARD.\nTake it as you will, but I think this signifies the end of an era. The \"EDM\" glory days are in the past. I think Insomniac sees this as the point where they need to start adapting with the times."},"67g7it":{"author":"ManBearPig1869","id":"67g7it","created_utc":1493123238,"num_comments":15,"score":23,"title":"Full Bassrush Pool Party lineup coming this week!"},"67hrjm":{"author":"Iflosswithbarbedwire","id":"67hrjm","created_utc":1493138706,"num_comments":150,"score":27,"title":"Hard Summer lineup: Safe to say all these artists won't be playing EDC?"},"67ig87":{"author":"Jesseroberto1894","id":"67ig87","created_utc":1493144761,"num_comments":11,"score":3,"title":"Bassnectar EDC?","selftext":"Sooo Bassnectar is playing electric forest which is insomniac BUT he is now known to be on the lineup for HARD summer...sooo what are his chances for EDC?"},"67ihm4":{"author":"juicyyy89","id":"67ihm4","created_utc":1493145089,"num_comments":7,"score":8,"title":"EDC solo","selftext":"Going VIP and solo for the first time!!( went to EDC in 2010 and 2012) im pumped but kinda sad my squad all bailed. any one done vip before? if anyone in there holla at me and ill buy u a drink!\nI was thinking about who im hopeful to see: (assuming they go)\n\nArmin\nseven lions\nTiesto\nslushii\nmartin garrix\nAndrew Rayel\nnghtmare\nborgore\nmarkus schultz\n and many more... cant wait for Thursday when the lineup drops and 6/18 is gettin close!"},"67il6m":{"author":"DontSweatITjustRedit","id":"67il6m","created_utc":1493145973,"num_comments":5,"score":2,"title":"So stage 7 most likely gone.. but what about Corona beach as a replacement?","selftext":"The beach made it to Nocturnal and I'm pretty sure it made it to Escape (was in attendance but seriously cant remember).

Why non-edm artists, DJ khaled added to the lineup?","selftext":"Can someone explain? WHY IS DJ KHALED added to the lineup? He's performs a lot, but he's barely a DJ, is considered a funny joke, talks too much, his coachella 2017 set wasn't impressive,  Is EDC in the beginning stages of being a sell out? Going away a bit from it's core root sounds.  Rave culture's edm music and diversity is made up of sub genres like big room, trance, hardstyle, techno, house, dubstep, drum n bass, future bass, trap, electro, edm pop (Calvin harris, Zedd, Chainsmokers, etc) etc. being some of the main ones.  Now they wanna throw in a little non-rave music artists like DJ Khaled & Metro Boom who are basically all rap, hiphip, R&B.  Metro Boom being a tiny bit of trap.  It's very bizarre and they don't belong at EDC.  What's next? More non-rave artists slowly slipping in the lineup, like rock bands like Metallica, Red hot chili peppers, Linkin park, Radio head? More trap, hiphop, rap R&B artists like Travis Scott, Gucci Maine, 2Chainz, Lil John, or radio pop stars like Britney spears, Miley Cyrus, Justin bieber, Lady Gaga, Beyonce? Billboard and radio top 100 mainstream artists.  \n\n¬†\n\nCuz they have massive fans and help sell more tickets, help it sell out sooner IF these names were added. Along with this would bring a big chunk of non-fans of rave culture.  But it's ODD and messes with the integrity and core sound of rave music.  This is the first year in vegas, it hasn't sold out as fast and expected.  Usually they brag about it selling out first, lineup gets released 2nd.  Not the case this year.  Some factors being the higher rising ticket prices, some say it's too expensive, lots of people are becoming more careful, frugal with their money want to save some, new nevada state entertainment tax, lots of hotels are starting to charge for parking, and several other factors to why it hasn't sold out this year fast as usual.  Maybe in the future, EDC will be 80% rave music subgenres, than 20% hiphip, rap, R&B, rock, pop, etc.? Seems like a possibility.  Maybe one day EDC Vegas, the largest music festival in North America in terms of attendance @ 135k+ people per day for 3 days will be a \"variety of genres\" festival like Coachella, Bonnaroo, and no longer just edm rave music.  Or they can add a stage just for them.  How other music festivals handle genres, give them their own stage.  Like how Coachella has the Sahara tent for edm music.\n\n¬†\n\nWanna hear from the veteran ravers who have been in the rave scene for 5-15+ years.  What direction and music genre changes, additions do you think EDC will be making in the future? The commercialization and mainstream aspect of it.

With the Hardstyle events that go from like 9pm-6am usually the \"headliners\" play around 1-3am and then the heavy stuff which I'm there for in the first place; the raw and core play after that at the end, as they're more niche I suppose for the lack of a better term. \nAnyways now I have given my life story, what I'm trying to ask is - how do they structure the acts within Edc? Do all the headliners and big named acts play each day at the same time as one another? Or Are they spread out throughout the time slots?

You can also call Front Gate Tickets to see where your shipment is and/or set up will call pickup @ **888.512.7469**. Also here's the [Front Gate Tickets Support Site](http://support.frontgatetickets.com). \n\nIf you are coming from outside of the USA, you have no choice but to go to will call for your tickets.

Remember, even though our community is friendly, caring, and kind, there are ticket scammers out there that are willing to take advantage. \n\n**Tickets are still not sold out**, so you have to ask yourself if saving a few dollars is worth the chance of getting scammed! Be vigilant, if something seems to good to be true, it probably is. Trust your instincts.\n\n**Where can I register my Wristband? Do I have to register my wristband?**\n\n[You can register it here](http://insom.co/EDCLVwristband). The only way to recover your wristband if it is lost or stolen is to have it registered. Additionally, there is emergency contact information stored in your wristband as part of the registration process, if anything should happen to you. There is a $40 fee for a replacement wristband.\n\n**Well this is embarassing, I didn't listen to everyone and put my wristband on early/on the wrong hand, how can I get it off? I sold my wristband after I attended one of the nights, how can I get it off without damaging it?**\n\n[Here's a short how-to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcALJm9n5lA) to remove the wristband without damaging anything. **DON'T PUT YOUR WRISTBAND ON UNTIL FRIDAY BEFORE YOU LEAVE YOUR HOTEL!** It goes on your right wrist, and should be able to fit a finger underneath for breathing room.\n\n**I'm going solo to the fest, how can I make friends, I need a place to stay, etc.**\n\nThere are several ways of doing this. You can use the search function on the subreddit. There's also [some Facebook groups dedicated to solo journeys to EDC](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1528695257402603/). Once again, trust your instincts here and only stay with people that you can properly personally have vetted ahead of time. \n\nAlso, one of our mods made [this megathread post](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/6ejgtp/megathread_post_your_meet_ups_hotel_pregaming/) for meet ups, ride shares, hotel shares, and any other social activities!\n\nLastly, [here's a subreddit lodging sheet that someone started](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OwD5XIZ2Ah80rITBCnrt7UOmklu13IeVrIHPUft6jjI/edit#gid=0).\n\n**Live sets just aren't doing it for me, I need a feel for what this place is like before I attend!**\n\nCheck out [Under the Electric Sky on Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/70300667), or [The Electric Daisy Carnival Experience trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzSFZtRGeqs) from when the festival was still in L.A. If you can find The Electric Daisy Carnival Experience online for free somewhere or even for a couple bucks to stream it, I think it's a much better movie than the Under the Electric Sky movie.\n\n---\n\n#FAQ\n\n**When do the set times drop? When does the app update? I can't find the app on the app store, what gives?!**\n\nSet times and app updates usually happen the week of the festival. Currently, the Insomniac app is set to Middlelands still. It will update soon, go ahead and install it now to be prepared.\n\n**Do you have a handy list of DJs performing, on what days and on what stage?**\n\n[Sure do! I took this from a user on the Facebook group, and made a spreadsheet of my own](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LFVd-aS0JuRhC6YDKYudlJnxvpbcqa44u-KYDvUpuPc/edit?usp=sharing). I'll be adding the set times when they are released. The second tab is just my personal lineup of who I have targeted, feel free to ignore that, or make a copy of your own and alter the 2nd tab to your liking! \n\nOpen the sheet and go to File > Make a copy... Name it and then add it to your Google Drive to edit like I did! \n\n**Hey my favorite DJ isn't coming to the festival this year, which ones are like them?**\n\nUser /u/raatl started [this thread, that looks to answer just that](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/6df5ga/lets_have_a_hey_relectricdaisycarnival_i_like_dj/)!\n\n**What about pool parties or other EDC Week events?**\n\n[Official site here](http://lasvegas.electricdaisycarnival.com/edcweek/) for a list of events and tickets.\n\n**What time should I leave the strip? How long does it take to get to/from to the speedway? What time should I leave the event to beat traffic?**\n\nEDC is not like a local DJ show and Las Vegas traffic SUCKS. Parking lots open at 5PM, so I would strive to leave the strip right around that time. Without traffic it will take you anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. The longer into the night you wait to leave the worse off traffic will be and the longer it will take to get to the show. I have heard nightmare scenarios of 2 or 3 hour shuttle rides, so don't let it happen to you!   \n   \nTypically, you can leave before the sunrise sets or about halfway through it and not have too bad of a wait in traffic back to the strip in the morning! At the end of night 3, keep in mind normal people are also heading to work since it will technically be Monday morning. That's just going to add to the clusterfuck of traffic on I-15 and Las Vegas Blvd. Plan accordingly! If you are driving have a cooler in the trunk with water bottles!\n\n**With all the terrorist attacks lately, what can I expect at EDC? Would it ever happen here, etc?**\n\nListen, the Speedway is right next door to a U.S. Air Force base and the event is 45 minutes into the desert and costs upwards of $400 to attend. That is a ton of work and a lot of hurdles for someone to go out there and do harm. Also, security will be checking that your wristbands are on before you are allowed into the lines to wait for the gates to open.   \n   \nThe Strip itself would be a better target if it were to even happen just due to the density of the crowd there. Expect a lot more cops than usual outside of the venue before you get inside! Don't let these people scare you from having a good time, that is the reason they are doing it, don't let them hinder our lives!\n\n**Do you know of any playlists that has all the artists music on it that are playing at EDC?**\n\n[For the past two years I've made Spotify playlists of the stages](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/68cu9i/edc_las_vegas_2017_artists_spotify_playlists_all/)! Check them out and listen to some DJs you've never heard before!\n\n**Are we doing the Reddit meetup again this year?**\n\nWe sure are. [Check out /u/CzarCruise's post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/6eamdf/6th_annual_edc_reddit_meetup_information/)!\n\n**What can I bring into the festival? What can't I bring into the festival? What are the searches like?**\n\nThe searches could be TSA style, or you could barely get touched at all. It's pretty random. Consider stash boxers or compression underwear to get your favors inside or items that are disallowed like LED gloves, etc. \n\nIf you take your time to observe the security, you can usually get a feel of who is being a hard-ass for a dime raise for busting someone and who is just doing their job quickly and efficiently.   \n   \nAs for allowed and disallowed items, [here's an image of those things](http://i.imgur.com/0EEGVeP.png). Also, here's some [totem guidelines](http://i.imgur.com/xJvyd5J.png).\n\n**Any further questions, feel free to comment below, or visit the [EDC Las Vegas info page](http://lasvegas.electricdaisycarnival.com/info/)!**\n\n---\n\n#Tips and Tricks!\n\n* Call your bank/credit card companies and let them know you will be traveling to Vegas to avoid holds on your account.\n* Be vigilant on the Strip. Everyone is trying to hustle. Street performers will expect tips if you take pictures!\n* Hit up a Vegas buffet at least one day.\n* Stretch beforehand in your hotel room. Your muscles will thank you in the morning!\n* Wear comfy shoes and/or get insoles to replace the \"stock\" insoles that come with your shoes. Also, consider moleskin if your feet are prone to blistering from rubbing against your socks. Your feet will thank you!\n* Get to the festival early. Stop by the merchandise tent first thing. Items sell out fast. Consider a mobile charging locker to store your merchandise in! Additionally, if you bring all of your sealed items in on the first day (wipes, chapstick, cigarettes, gum, tampons, etc), you can keep them all in your locker overnight and not have to worry about getting 3 of each sealed item to bring in every single day. **REMEMBER! Hide your lock from people that may peer over your shoulder or look at your combination wristband and try to get into your locker.** Remain vigilant inside the festival!\n* After you get your merch and put it in your locker, you next stop should be one of the four free water stands to fill up your hydration pack or water bottle. It's very important to remain hydrated, especially while the sun is still out and bearing down on you! If you tip some of the vendors, they will give you ice if the warm water turns you off.\n* If you need to eat something, consider the food trucks instead of the concession stand food. The food trucks have their company name out there and on the line when compared to the generic concession stand stuff, the quality of the food is unparalleled. Don't make the same mistake as I did last year and get a raw onion sandwich masked as a \"cheese steak\".\n* Bring earplugs! Tinnitus sucks!\n* Wear sunscreen! Remember, if you are staying all night the sun is up at like 5AM and starts beaming down on you almost immediately.\n* If you want to ride the rides, get there early or risk missing sets while standing in line! Some rides you will be waiting for an hour or more at peak times.\n* Time-stamp your texts! There will be cell service congestion. Stamping your texts will help your friends know whenever you truly sent a message!\n* Bring an external battery pack in with you to charge your phone if you are someone who likes to take a lot of photo and video!\n* Bring cash. Credit and debit cards could possibly be hit or miss if the speedway's internet network would happen to shit the bed! Don't be stuck without a way to pay for something you need!\n* Remember to take it easy night 1! EDC is a marathon not a sprint!\n* Emergen-C packets are a lifesaver. Take one before the festival every night in order to help you recover from the night before and prepare for the festival ahead!\n* Take some time to look up and enjoy the fireworks!\n* Don't forget about the EDC parade down Rainbow Road every night! You should at least try to check it out one time out of the three nights you are there!\n* Follow your favorite artists' social media so that you know if they may show up unannounced (pls Kaskade), or if they are doing any surprise sets on one of the art cars, etc.\n* Send a post card to back home at the EDC Town Post Office. Mine didn't come through last year but I have heard of successful ones sending out! Check out EDC Town in general. It's pretty sweet.\n* If you are feeling at all dehydrated or anything else medical related, visit one of the medical tents. Staff is super friendly and you WILL NOT get in trouble for seeking medical treatment, no matter your condition. If you can't make it to the medical tent, look for a Ground Control staff member to assist you or any of your friends! Look out for your fellow ravers. If you see something, say something! This will keep everyone safe and having a good time.\n* If you are going to do drugs, and especially MDMA, I suggest only doing it 1 out of the 3 nights and finding something else for the other two days. Me and my crew plan on doing edibles the first night, rolling night 2, and just chilling with some shatter night 3. Everyone is different, but be safe, and TEST YOUR SHIT. Do not buy drugs at the festival. Not only do you risk getting bunk shit, but undercover cops are everywhere!\n* If you are going to drink alcohol, do so in moderation and stay hydrated! For every alcoholic drink you have, you should drink 8-16oz of water!\n* If you are a girl, bring wipes! Usually the porta-potties run out of toilet paper. It's just a fact of the festival and usually they don't get resupplied. You will thank me if you get caught in this situation.\n* Bring a hand fan for the water lines! They can get pretty hot and people will love you!\n* Try to catch at least one sunrise set one of the nights. I recommend night 2, since everyone and their mothers will be staying on night 3. Plus, Monday morning rush hour traffic on night 3.\n* If you have a large crew and need to split up to see different sets, plan a meeting spot! Try to pick something that is stationary, like the locker area, the cooling area, one of the buildings in EDC Town, etc.\n* Buy a smoothie or a lemonade. They are a nice change of pace from warm hydrant water.\n* Call your Dad on Father's Day before you head out for night 3!\n* Get a bandana and tie it around your neck for each night you are out there. Put it over your mouth and nose when the dust gets to be too much. Your lungs will thank you, plus you get to look like a bandit. Win/win.\n* Asian trains are going to happen, so use them to your advantage. Become the caboose to go into or out of the crowds and use your manners! Excuse me, thank you, etc go a long way when navigating the crowd!\n* Bring good vibes, leave the judgement at the gates, and most of all, enjoy yourself and smile! EDC is a glorious wonderland of fun. Extrude the vibes you with to receive back to you and you will have a great time, I promise!\n\n---\n\n##Let me know of any tip and tricks in the comments and I'll add them!\n\n#I can't wait to be under the electric sky with you all ~~in just~~ ~~12~~ ~~11~~ ~~10~~ ~~9~~ ~~8~~ ~~7~~ ~~6~~ ~~5~~ ~~4~~ ~~3~~ ~~2~~ ~~1~~ ~~more days~~ TONIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},"6f7lfc":{"author":"Dopamiine","id":"6f7lfc","created_utc":1496586487,"num_comments":57,"score":15,"title":"Anyone else scared to go alone?","selftext":"Hey everyone, I'm a male(22) going solo this year because my one friend that was going with me, decided last minute not to go. but the lineup is so good, the closer it gets and the more I think about it, the scarier its becoming for me to think of going alone.

Like the other guy posted, they're looking into a complete overhaul of the shuttle system. He said he's been hearing us loud and clear and he's satisfied with how EDC is inside the venue, but very unsatisfied with the experience getting there. He's had to delay because he does not want to announce anything before all the pieces are in place.\n\nOther things: I get the sense that insomniac lost money or underperformed last year. He was responding to a question about why nocturnal was being downsized and he implied they were saturating the market with festivals - \"quality not quant-\" but then stopped himself, and said he liked the idea of a \"boutique\" festival, and what better venue than Nocturnal.\n\nEDC line up not finalized till about 3-6 months from the festival date.\n\nEDC LV will always be dance music, though they're fine with artists bringing out hip hop acts. If any stage would have hip hop, it would be Cosmic Meadow because it's curated by Audiotistic and they have hip hop acts at their show. That being said, he doesn't think EDCLV will have hip hop as a lineup artist, for now.\n\nHe had no warning that Gary was leaving Hard but he emphasized more than once that it was for something he felt was a better opportunity. Also confirmed that Insomniac has owned Hard for the past few years, but let them operate on their own.\n\nAlso mentioned he'd love to have Skrillex there next year, so tweet him.\n\nEdit: Someone also suggested they do packages with certain hotels so that if you're staying there you have your own shuttle to the venue. He immediately said that to look for the transportation announcement in a few weeks. I'm thinking something like this will be incorporated into his plan.\n\nAlso, he said that it's not that the shuttle situation gets \"worse\" every year. They figure out their problems on any given year, but they fall behind in following through with those solutions the following year and the problem feels amplified (im assuming freeway construction and bigger crowds).\n\nDedicated plane packages (like tomorrowland) are out of the question because US airlines don't work like that. It's something that TomorrowWorld could not secure when they had their shows. That being said, he loves Tomorrowland, but prefers the American flavor of things."},"6tbocp":{"author":"qlfflwh","id":"6tbocp","created_utc":1502579710,"num_comments":4,"score":7,"title":"I know it's kinda late but can anyone find ID for edc lineup reveal mix @38:47?","selftext":"I fell in love with that song right away but I can't find it with shazam.

I will be updating this until it's a full record of the Q&amp;A, as well as any that Pasquale feels like answering later tonight.\n\n[AMA Link here](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/72tj66/i_am_pasquale_rotella_experience_creator_night/)\n\n* **Q: Can we have details about how the shuttle experience will be improved? so wondering if there will be reentry for campers? And how the issue of sunlight will be dealt with in the \"turnkey\" tents?**\n * *A: We have confirmed the third party company we will be using for shuttles and they provide transportation for the largest live events in the world. I am excited about collaborating with them to make it the best it‚Äôs ever been. Also, great camping question! The tents we are setting up will provide protection from sunlight. There are also multiple shade areas for not only activities around the campgrounds but also at the center camp, which is called The Mesa. We‚Äôll have more details about this when we announce camping soon!*\n* **Q: With camping being added and festival hours being extended, are there plans to change the re-entry policy?**\n * *A: Yes, during festival hours you can come in and out of the show as long as you have a camping wristband. We will have in's and out's at the festival for campers, but non-campers will not be able to enter the campgrounds.*\n* **Q: Can we get a ball park range for camping passes? Also will they be available in a payment plan as well? Lastly can we get an estimated time that they will go on sale?**\n * *A: It will be between $250-$275 to bring in your RV, and we‚Äôll have hook-ups available for an additional fee. As far as campers, there will be several different packages available. It depends how many people you‚Äôre with and what packages you choose, but you‚Äôll be able to get something between $450 to $2,500 for 4 days of camping. This will all be laid out clearly before we go on sale with camping options.*\n* **Q: You stated people who purchase tickets will have first chance at buying camping passes, does this apply to payment plans as well?**\n * *A: Yes.*\n* **Q: Will there be options for tents with air conditioning?**\n * *A: All tents will have air conditioning.*\n* **Q: Will it be possible to bring your personal tent and set-up(similar to Electric Forest) or only turnkey tents will be available?**\n * *A: In 2018 only turnkey tents will be available. We need to make sure that everyone has darkness and air conditioning and is comfortable. We're open to exploring something different in future years.*\n* **Q: How likely would it be to get a small stage, maybe even sponsored by like 7-Up again, inside of the huge shuttle tent outside the speedway?**\n * *A: We're capable of building that, no problem. No plans for that right now but I like the idea. Thanks for the suggestion! That said, we do not plan on having a long wait at shuttles with our new provider.*\n* **Q: Im a Cast Member at Disneyland and Ive seen you and Holly at the park often, how much inspiration from Disneyland goes into these festivals if any?**\n * *A: I get inspiration from so many different places. Even going all the way back to the original LA warehouse underground scene. But yes, theme parks as well!*\n* **Q: Does the new shuttle company plan on upping the amount of security monitoring these lines?**\n * *A: The answer to that question is yes. Shuttle operations are gonna be completely different next year.*\n* **Q: Was edc ny ended over low turnout, high cost, or a bit of both?**\n * *A: The reason we no longer organize EDC New York is because we felt like we needed to find a better venue.*\n* **Q: What was the first festival you ever attended?**\n * *A: Grateful Dead show in Southern California with Mama Irene.*\n* **Q: Are there any plans to update QuantumValley stage?**\n * *A: Yes, I'm excited to say that it‚Äôs going to be a new open-air stage.*\n* **Q: What about updating neonGARDEN?!**\n * *A: We are looking at doing a new design but it‚Äôs not confirmed yet.*\n* **Q: Will the livestreaming experience be improved for 2018?**\n * *A: I've gotten mixed opinions from people for what they'd like to see on this. I do appreciate your input. We're capable of doing longer sets. Maybe I should get a vote on this from fans.*\n* **Q: Pasquale will you improve premier parking for edc 2018?**\n * *A: The only way that we‚Äôll have it as an option is if it is 110% improved.*\n* **Q: Where do you lean on the pineapple on the pizza argument?**\n * *A: All toppings are welcome here :)*\n* **Q: Do you have any updates on a location for Middlelands?**\n * *A: We are still searching for the right venue and the plan is to definitely bring it back but not before finding the right place. Glad we crossed paths!*\n* **Q: Pasquale, I've always wondered this, what happens to the main stages after you're done using them. Where is Kinetic Cathedral for example. Scrapped for parts?**\n * *A: I have some artifacts in my backyard, there are some in the Insomniac warehouse, and we are looking to make an Insomniac Production Museum.*\n* **Q: Where exactly is the camping going to be on the speedway grounds?**\n * *A: Surrounding properties outside the Speedway grounds.*\n* **Q: Hey what is your favorite non insomniac festival and why? If it is burning man, what's your second favorite?**\n * *A: If you‚Äôre not letting me pick Burning Man, then I would say Boom Festival.*\n* **Q: Having a large quantity of DJ's at EDC is good for diversity but have you thought about lowering the amount of DJ's at the event in place of longer sets?**\n * *A: We will have artists periodically play extended set times depending on the genre or stage they are playing at.*\n* **Q: How safe is camping? Are personal items susceptible to stealing/looting while we're at the festival?**\n * *A: If you're in an RV I suggest you lock it. If you're staying in a tent, we ask that you bring your own lock as the zippers will have luggage lock holes. Security will be roaming the grounds as well. You'll be able to access your vehicle if you want to lock items in there too.*\n* **Q: Is there any plan to bring a megastructure stage back?**\n * *A: There are no plans right now, but there's the possibility of bringing the megastructure back, just not for the circuitGROUNDS. It's not big enough to accommodate the people at that stage.*\n* **Q: Will shuttle prices go up with this change? When will you announce shuttle stops? Can we expect to have the same ones as last year?**\n * *A: Not only are the prices not going up but shuttles will be immensely improved. All stops will be announced before the shuttles go on sale.*\n* **Q: Mr. Rotella, my question to you is, have you ever Kandiflipped?**\n * *A: Yes but I‚Äôve been sober for many years now*\n* **Q: After so many years of holding EDC in June, what was the final tipping point for you to move EDC to May? Moving forward, how much involvement do you think you will have with the HARD brand of events, and what is your vision for the Hard brand?**\n * *A: The biggest factor in our move to May was the cooler weather. It allows us to do camping, have extended hours, and the temperatures are way more comfortable for Headliners. It also takes if off of Father‚Äôs Day, which is great for me and all the other Dads. We‚Äôve owned HARD for 4 years but haven‚Äôt operated it, with the exception of helping with HARD Summer at Glen Helen this past August. Moving forward we‚Äôll continue with operations.*\n* **Q: Just wondering what the timeline for camping? What date could people check in and what is the latest they could check out?**\n * *A: Campers will definitely be able to check in on Thursday, but we're looking at the possibility of Wednesday. Checkout will be Monday around 7pm.*\n* **Q: Will we ever see stages relocated? Or since the system is already in place, will things forever stay the same?**\n * *A: We don‚Äôt have any plans to but if you think there‚Äôs a reason to, please let me know.*\n* **Q: Pasquale, I LOVE all the main stage designs, but can we please have more LED on the main stage?**\n * *A: We pretty much use all the LED in the United States for EDC Las Vegas every year so that might be difficult unless you own an LED company.*\n* **Q: In the campground can we get above ground pools and have pool parties with DJs?**\n * *A: That is being explored and likely to happen. Plus a lot more activities will happen. I'm excited about it.*\n* **Q: Are you going to continue this trend of booking artists that are not part of the EDM scene? (DJ khaled, metro boomin, etc.) A lot of headliners complained about being ripped off by the water vendors and being denied ice in 100¬∞ weather. Are you aware of this at all?**\n * *A: Thanks for supporting us for the past three years and reaching out to me today! For your first question, we'll always experiment with things out of the box. We are a dance music festival first and foremost, but we're gonna have fun sometimes, especially in Las Vegas, California. ;) As far as the water question, I never heard this before but thanks for bringing it to my attention. I'll speak to the head of F&amp;B at the Speedway. Good thing is the average temp in May is 64 at night. Thanks again. I'll get on this.*\n* **Q: I know at '17, there were some 'secret' tips and tricks of survival (including cooldown rooms, or earplugs available at medical). Are there any you would be willing to share with me about next year? I have heard that somewhere on the speedway, there is a tattoo booth that will tattoo the insomniac logo on you, is this true? How do you manage planning for unforeseen circumstances? For example, last year, traffic improved every day because you changed the system every day. Is there a council that brainstorms with you, or do you do it yourself? I know Green Velvet got 2 nights in '17 to perform; why is this? Not that I am complaining (I attended both), but why does this happen?**\n * *A: Okay, here we go. There are so many tips. You can find them on our website and in our festival guides. No secret tattoo booth at the Speedway in recent years, although we have had tattoo artists in vending booths before. I'm sure they'll tattoo anything on you that you ask for. I have an amazing team behind me here at Insomniac, and we troubleshoot in realtime during the festival. We also work with the city and the Speedway. Green Velvet played 2 sets because Joseph Capriati couldn't make it last minute. I was there for that second set and it was awesome.*\n* **Q: Have you ever considered a new event or stage at one of your current festivals dedicated to old school electronic music?**\n * *A: Fatboy Slim just played EDC Japan and Justice just played HARD Summer. Daft Punk could be their own festival! I love the old school vibes and sounds so we'll continue to bring some of them out more often.*\n* **Q: Can you make another film about EDC?**\n * *A: There's no plans now but we hope to make another film.*\n* **Q: I was wondering who exactly is Camp OG?**\n * *A: I used to throw warehouse parties called Insomniac every Friday in '93. Camp OG are a lot of the ravers that would support me in the early years, and still attend today. Insomniac would not exist without their support back in the day. They set up their own turn tables and renegade sound camps at our festivals. They DJ behind the decks and they play a lot of the early rave tunes from '89-'95.*\n* **Q: Improved cell service and wi-fi at the festival?**\n * *A: Cell service at EDC is difficult. We've tried improving it -- and we've made Wi-Fi available for free in Carnival Square -- but it's also nice to turn off for the weekend. Pro-tip: Always set up a meeting spot at the festival prior to entering.*\n* **Q: Any chance on bringing back the Circuit Grounds megastructure?**\n * *A: I love the megastructure but it could not handle the amount of people that wanted to be at circuitGROUNDS. We have to make sure that people have room to dance, we have a good flow, and it's safe.*\n* **Q: Hey Pasquale, what's going on with the Mexico on sale? Do you have plans to donate to those affected by the earthquake?**\n * *A: The on sale will be October 16/17 for EDC Mexico and will raise funds for those affected by the earthquake. The same goes for EDC Orlando for those affected by the hurricane. And it doesn‚Äôt stop there. All of our major festivals support communities in need.*\n* **Q: Are there any strategies you and your team are thinking up this year to cope with the trash problem?**\n * *A: Although our Headliners don‚Äôt always choose to Leave No Trace, at the end of the event, we never leave one. I do want to create incentives for people to clean up after themselves, as it puts out a positive message and beautifies the venue during event hours. But all trash is definitely picked up at EDC. The difference is that we do it rather than rely on the fans. I'd love for this to change.*\n* **Q: Will 2018 see this same mix of artists on the art cars, any plans for some new cars?**\n * *A: Yes and yes :)*\n* **Q: How long will Early Owl be available? I get paid Friday and friends are getting their monies next Tuesday. Someone wants to know why the ban on gloves and will it ever be lifted?**\n * *A: Early Owl will by sold out by Friday but you can get a layaway plan for less than $50 if that helps. I can't promise you anything about gloves but I'm always open to new ideas on how we can protect the culture and allow them.*\n* **Q: Can you have your team create 20ft tall electric misting towers and place multiple versions of them strategically smack dab in where the crowds cheer on their favorite djs?**\n * *A: I love how detailed your suggestion is. The average weather for this year's EDC is 64 degrees at night so not sure we'll need misters on this level even though we will have some in both the festival and the campgrounds.*\n* **Q: Can you get Elrow to host the Neon Garden one of the nights this year?**\n * *A: There's no plans but we'd be totally open to that.*\n* **Q: Were you aware that the VIP security lines this year were exponentially longer than the GA lines? Do you have any plans to change how VIP is delivered or is the whole point of VIP to give people that status and a few perks and nothing else?**\n * *A: This is the first I'm hearing of that. The VIP line is traditionally much faster than GA. If you ever experience issues like that I encourage you to reach out to me or Insomniac via social media. We can't fix it unless we know about it. The VIP experience has nothing to do with status. We provide services that are unique. To some people it's worth it, to some people it's not. We get repeat customers who don't like being in the mix, while others like the energy in the crowd outside VIP. That said, we like to improve so I'm gonna keep your notes. Thank you!*\n* **Q: Whatever happened to the giant daisy?!**\n * *A: It's in our Insomniac Warehouse but we should definitely dust it off and bring it out one of these days.*\n* **Q: Are there any plans to expand even more the EDC brand worldwide? We had spin-off editions in Brazil (2015), India (2016) and Japan (2017). Can these countries expect another edition soon?**\n * *A: Yeah we love spreading EDC around the globe. We feel it's a positive movement we want to share with the world. If we ever go somewhere and then stop, it doesn't mean that we're not coming back. We like to change things up by moving the experience around.*\n* **Q: Now that Gary Richards has left Hard Events are you going to take over?**\n * *A: Insomniac has owned HARD for 4 years now. We just didn't operate it. We helped behind the scenes with HARD Summer that took place at Glen Helen this past August. That will continue moving forward.*\n* **Q: is there anything overarching that you always look for when hiring? Have you ever considered bringing an event north of the border to Canada?**\n * *A: Passion, creativity, drive, loyalty, selflessness, and love for this culture and its history. We have considered bringing an event to Canada but nothing is confirmed right now.*\n* **Q: Pasquale, do you play Fantasy Football? If so, who are your top players on your roster?**\n * *A: I don't play Fantasy Football but I do play Galaga and Donkey Kong.*\n* **Q: What are your thoughts on DJ Khalid's performance at this past EDC?**\n * *A: It's a bummer when any artist's set is disrupted due to technical difficulties. He was not someone you would typically see at our events but it could have been fun had it worked out.*\n* **Q: Will EDC LV be going \"cashless\" and make the attendees utilize wristbands for payments in 2018 similar to other music festivals?**\n * *A: No plans for it right now but is that something you think we should do?*\n* **Q: Will Mandalay Bay be the location of the Premium Shuttles again in 2018?**\n * *A: There's a completely new plan for shuttles next year and that will be announced very shortly, before they go on sale.*\n* **Q: Is there any plans to expand the amount of time dnb is played at EDC?**\n * *A: I want to start off by saying I love you. I wish there were hundreds of you asking this question. Drum and bass is in my heart and soul. We've had DnB acts play more and more but the stages tend to empty out a bit, but we're gonna continue to push it because I'm a jungliest till I die!*\n* **Q: Are you planning on bringing more basscon stages to the bigger events like you did to Escape?**\n * *A: Basscon will host stages at several of our festivals throughout the year. It's not all planned out right now but we will be sure to continue giving the genre more and more love.*\n* **Q: Considering all the medical issues and circumstances that have occurred over the years at EDC and other Insomniac events, does Insomniac have a plan to improve medical tents or offer more AC areas for people to relax?**\n * *A: Insomniac does not face any different challenges than other festivals out there. I am so proud of our health &amp; safety team. We have some of the most innovative and best operations on the planet and I've traveled all over the world to festivals to get inspiration in this department. We will continue to come up with more ways to keep everyone who attends, happy and safe because we love every single person that comes through our doors. We also ask that people look out for one another. Self-responsibility is important.*\n* **Q: Do you think you could incorporate some fans or misting type machines to help keep things a-bit cooler in Neon Garden and Quantum Valley?**\n * *A: Even better, we've negotiated a deal with Mother Nature to decrease temperatures. But additionally, we are looking at both stages being open-air. ;)*\n* **Q: Out of all the festivals you have created, which one was your favorite to attend?**\n * *A: It's hard to pick because it's like choosing your favorite child. There are so many favorites. It's a tie between Nocturnal Wonderland at the Empire Polo Fields (we went until 6 AM!), the 20-year anniversary of EDC, Organic at Snow Summit in '96, or Middlelands. Oh, and the first year we did EDC at the LA Coliseum.*\n* **Q: Will you be re-designing ALL stages or just basspod,kinetic and wasteland?**\n * *A: We are exploring redesigning kineticFIELD, bassPOD, wasteLAND, neonGARDEN, circuitGROUNDS, and possibly the upside-downHOUSE. Look out for announcements to confirm what exactly we're gonna do.*\n* **Q: Two or three years back you said you would be writing a book / autobiography. Is that still something that is going to happen?**\n * *A: Yes, I'm working on it. It's not coming along as fast as I would like, but that's actually a good thing. So much has happened in the past year that I want to include. My main focus is producing events but it will eventually get done.*\n* **Q: With the absence of Mysteryland, I feel that an insomniac camping festival would be a huge hit in the Eastern United States, so, has it ever come across your mind?**\n * *A: Electric Forest is the only camping festival we have on the East Coast, but we're always looking to bring more!*\n* **Q: Can we have more diversity on the mainstage? Like the best of the best from each genre not just from the most popular genre?**\n * *A: Our attempt is to be diverse on kineticFIELD but if you and the users below don't feel there's enough of it, I'll focus on changing that. Thank you!*\n* **Q: You said that the people who first purchase their tickets will get access to camping passes first. Does that include someone on the payment plan?**\n * *A: Yes.*\n* **Q: Do you feel that you are currently fighting against an 'EDM Bubble' in the United States? We know you've seen the scene hit a slump before in the early 90's. If so, what's on your mind in terms of how you'll keep the energy going?**\n * *A: Dance music isn't going anywhere. It's always had times where it's more popular than other times, and in my eyes that's not a bad thing. It pushes artists to be even more innovative with their sound. But it doesn't matter how big or small it gets -- we're in this for life!*\n* **Q: Would you ever consider throwing an edc inspired cruise?**\n * *A: Yea an EDSEA has been considered many times. We will make it happen one of these days.*\n* **Q: With next year being the 25th anniversary of Insomniac, should we plan something special for the OG's from the first Friday night parties?**\n * *A: Yes, I definitely want to organize a 25-year celebration of Insomniac in a special way. I don't know what we're going to do yet but we'll definitely incorporate old school rave tunes.*\n* **Q: Pasquale will VIP include free alcohol?**\n * *A: No, VIP does not include free alcohol.*\n* **Q: How and why did you book Deadmau5 for Countdown this year? How did this come about? Can we expect some major lineup changes for EDC as well?**\n * *A: I don't have any problems with anyone in the industry. There's perceptions out there that just aren't accurate. I'm all about creating things at events that make the attendees happy. It's not about me. We're excited to have him, and I'm happy there has been a good response!*\n* **Q: Why wont you release all dj sets recorded at edc?**\n * *A: We leave that up to the artists to make that decision.*\n* **Q: Will quantumVALLEY be open-air next year?**\n * *A: Yes.*\n* **Q: Will you continue to bring the classic house to every EDC festival moving forward?**\n * *A: I always want to bring a little history to EDC. Let me know what suggestions you have!*\n* **Q: Does the RV need to be under your name or can you rent one from a third party?**\n * *A: I think what you're asking is can you bring in rented RV's and the answer is yes.*\n* **Q: Have you ever thought about throwing a one stage massive in the damus for Factory 93?? Will the factory on Naud st. Be used ever again?**\n * *A: There are no plans for that right now but NOS could work for a Factory 93 party. As for Naud St. no plans for that right now either but it's possible. We are working on new options.*\n* **Q: Why do you insist that us techno fans ‚Äúdon‚Äôt want more production‚Äù?**\n * *A: It's not about more production. It's about a certain style of production. Sound needs to be amazing. Visuals need to be amazing. There's a certain vibe that techno has and it doesn't always require confetti!*\n* **Q: Why did you chose edc lv on the week of finals?**\n * *A: I'm glad you asked. We did lots of research before picking the date and found that most colleges -- 85-90% -- are actually out. Of that 10 or 15% of students who do have their finals, most would have had their finals before EDC weekend.*\n* **Q: My question for you is if there has been talk about pushing EDC week events to the week following EDC rather than prior?**\n * *A: We are exploring both options for EDC Week. What does everyone think? The weekend before the festival or the weekend after, into Memorial Day Weekend?*\n* **Q: What's your favorite kind of weed?**\n * *A: Indica.*\n* **Q: What is Rainbow's opinion on EDC Las Vegas?**\n * *A: She says she wants to work with Papa when she's older.*\n* **Q: What‚Äôs it like mingling in the crowd during your events? Do you ever get tired of sweaty ravers touching you and asking for pictures?**\n * *A: I love meeting people and I love hearing what everyone thinks. I learn most from all of you and I've been a sweaty raver many times.*\n* **Q: In the industry, are radius clauses here to stay?**\n * *A: Radius clauses existed in the concert industry before I was born. They will probably exist after I'm gone. Despite what's been said, every body has them. You, the fans, don't want to see the same acts at every festival.*\n* **Q: Will White Wonderland ever come back?**\n * *A: It's great to hear that you enjoyed it. There's no plans right now but you're making me think I should bring it back. I'll keep it in mind and share it with the team!*\n* **Q: What are the odds of EDC returning to its original home, LA?**\n * *A: Anything is possible but no plans for that right now. Finding the right location is the challenge.*\n* **Q: Why doesn't Insomniac use urinal stations for guys rather than porta-potties?**\n * *A: I wish we had more access to those here in the States.*"},"74dy3o":{"author":"Dafunkk","id":"74dy3o","created_utc":1507181007,"num_comments":14,"score":6,"title":"Countdown NYE","selftext":"Who's going to Countdown?!

Must-Read for First-Timers, Photo-enthusiasts, and Introverts.","selftext":"Heads up, long post.\n\nSo EDC LV 2016 was my first EDC ever, and while I had the time of my life I could have been better prepared. I went with a group of friends that were all EDC vets and they knew a ton about the ins and outs of EDC. And yet despite their experience, there‚Äôs a bunch of stuff I wish I‚Äôd been advised/warned about. I‚Äôd like to give you the advice I wish I‚Äôd gotten before walking through the gates at the raceway for the first time. In case you‚Äôre going alone, or everyone in your crew is an EDC virgin, take this advice and keep it in your fanny pack for the big weekend. \n\nLet's get to it!\n\n1. PREPARE YOURSELF TO DEAL WITH THE HEAT.\n\nIf this isn't the first EDC tips article you've read, you've undoubtedly heard that the heat is INSANE at EDC LV. That heat is real. Very real. Heatstroke is also real. So keeping cool is key. \n\nYou can easily combat the heat by staying well hydrated, and taking breaks when you feel too hot. The folks at Insomniac who organized this wonderful weekend know how fucking hot it is out there so they've set up some sweet places for you to catch your breath without stepping away from the party. Be chill and keep these tips in mind:\n\nA. Visit the smaller \"indoor\" stages. The Smirnoff House had cold drinks and AC with DJ's spinning all night. I didn't take advantage of this stage last year and I wish I did. One of my Favorite DJs, Mija, made a surprise appearance and I missed it!\n\nB. Take some time to relax in carnival square, there's picnic tables, and cold drinks.\n\nC. The grass at Cosmic Meadow is probably the busiest, yet most chill of the chill zones. You can still hear whoever is playing a set but you can also lay back and chit chat with other peeps in the grass. However you'll need to go to the area off to the side of the Cosmic stage. The space directly in front is for people who want to bust-a-move. So to avoid being trampled, stick by the numerous art installations that are erected in the area between the stage and the port-a-potty bank.\n\nD. This really should have been Tip A, but drink lots of water. Like more water than you would drink on a normal day (obviously). You know those days when you get home and you‚Äôre like, ‚ÄúHm, I drank a lot of water today.‚Äù Drink a little more than that. But don‚Äôt drink just plain water. As you sweat your body is losing essential salts too. You can replenish these by eating real food or drinking one of the sports drinks they sell there. That‚Äôs a Powerade or Gatorade, not a Rockstar or a Monster.\n\n\nPRO-TIP: Bring a bandana, soak it in water, ring out the excess liquid, and tie it around your head or neck. As the water evaporates it will cool you off.\n\n2. PLAN YOUR NIGHT BUT, DON'T OVER-PLAN\n\nYou've made it to EDC and you don't have a plan. You're just here to party and chew bubble gum, and you're all outta gum, right? Wrong. Edc 20 had nine stages, and three moving ArtCars that had tunes pumping as they buzzed around the carnival. If you don't have a plan going in you're going to waste a lot of valuable time figuring out which stage is where, who's playing, etc. Valuable time you could be using swinging you trap arms, or shakin out that awesome rave wedgie.\n\nPlan to see about two or three artists you know, and are excited about each night. Make time to explore the other stages and catch a few sets from artists you've never heard of. You know when you walk into the food court at the mall and you sometimes just have to follow your nose. Do the same thing at EDC, just follow your ears instead. If you do this, 5 of your roughly 9 hours are taken up on the dance floor feeling the burn in your thighs. That leaves 4 hours to take a few breathers, stand in line to refill your camelback/Insomniac water bottle a couple times, stand in line grab a bite to eat, stand in line for a ride, stand in line for merch, stand in line for the bathroom. \n\n3. THERE‚ÄôS A LINE FOR EVERYTHING, MAKE THE BEST OF YOUR TIME IN THEM.\nStanding in line sucks. Standing in line while it‚Äôs hot outside double-sucks. Standing in line, in the heat, to overpay for something at a festival triple-sucks. Standing in line at EDC for some reason does not suck. Well, it doesn‚Äôt suck if you have the right attitude. Waiting to get to the front of whatever line you happen to be in is a perfect time to mingle with strangers/future friends. Remember these people are just as stoked to be here under the electric sky as you. You‚Äôve already got that in common with them. These will be some of the easiest strangers in the world to start a conversation with.\n\nNot so good at breaking the ice? Try this one: (Smile) ‚ÄúOh man, did you catch (insert name of artist you just saw here) at (stage name)?‚Äù That simple.\n\nThey‚Äôre going to say ‚ÄúYeah!‚Äù and then you can gab about how cool the set was. Or they‚Äôre going to say ‚ÄúNope.‚Äù Then you‚Äôre going to ask them who they came to see. And you and your new friend are going to trade artist recommendations. You‚Äôll probably never see this person again after the festival. If they are pretty cool and you make any sort of connection consider trading kandi.\n\n4. MAKE KANDI. IT‚ÄôS FUN. SERIOUSLY.\n\nI‚Äôll preface this section by saying the following is purely my opinion, and some people just seriously love beads. \n\nBut for most of us without bead obsessions, kandi, those little bead bracelets and cuffs you see everyone wearing, probably seem a little silly outside the rave context. You‚Äôre going to see some crazy elaborate and amazing bead creations. Take the time to be impressed. For a lot of people kandi is a way to express their creativity. And nothing is going to make that person you‚Äôre admiring feel cooler than if you took a second to walk up and say ‚ÄúHey, you look awesome!‚Äù \n\nAt big massives like EDC trading Kandi is not about collecting as many beads as you can. It‚Äôs about making a gesture to someone you made a connection with. Whether it‚Äôs someone close to you from your own EDC crew, or the girl who cools you off a bit with her hand fan while you‚Äôre neck deep in really, really sweaty shoulders. Trading or even giving away Kandi, for me, is a way to say ‚ÄúAw yeah, I see you. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre here.‚Äù Look up a youtube video on the proper way to trade kandi. Or, if you‚Äôre too damn cool for that and you‚Äôre comfortable being new in the scene, bring a few kandies to trade, look for the most kandied-out raver you can find and ask them to teach you how to trade. They‚Äôll dig it. Promise.\n\nFollow these rules and be one of the kool kandi kids: \na.\tNever just ask for kandi. If you wanna trade, then thats A-OK.\nb.\tNever trade away kandi that‚Äôs been traded to you.\nc.\tBe original. If you‚Äôre going to make bracelets w/ words, avoid super basic stuff, like ‚ÄúEDM‚Äù or ‚Äúcool‚Äù.\n\n5. PLUR, IT‚ÄôS YOUR CHOICE.\nOkay if you don‚Äôt know what PLUR is, it means PEACE. LOVE. UNITY. RESPECT. Or ‚Äúpills-left-us-retarded‚Äù depending on who you ask. But more on that in a bit. PLUR is the all around vibe when it comes to EDC and lots of other EDM focused events. But heck, you‚Äôre going to EDC so you probably knew all this right?\n\nWell here‚Äôs the thing, EDC is not some huge, hundred-thousand-person lovefest just waiting to accept you with a hug, a kiss, and a kandi bracelet. Hop into the wrong crowd and you‚Äôll soon find out that many festival goers don‚Äôt really give a shit about how much fun you‚Äôre having so long as you keep out of their dancing space. Those festival goers incidentally have harder elbows than your more plur-minded folk. Truth is, super-bros and wannabe Instagram queens flock to EDC by the tens of thousands and are only there to party hard with their own friends, drank, and smoke whatever they can get past security. And you know what? More power to them. It‚Äôs their EDC too, and they should live it up for those 72 hours how ever they want as long as it doesn‚Äôt cause outward harm or damage.\n\nIf you want plur vibes you‚Äôve got to put plur vibes out there first. High five a stranger. Compliment someone‚Äôs look. Ask someone if they‚Äôre okay if they look a little down. For god sakes make eye contact and nod. Anything! EDC is only as plur as you make it. Like attracts like, So come in peace. Love thy dance floor neighbor. Feel the unity as you and 15,000 bounce to the same beat. And say sorry when you accidently stomp on someone‚Äôs foot ‚Äòcuz you were going too damn hard. You are responsible for your own PLUR experience.\n\n6. THE DRUGS\nDrugs and EDC go together like fries and a Frosties from Wendy‚Äôs. They‚Äôre technically not supposed to, but hey‚Äî good is good. The EDM scene and drugs are closely tied together and have been for years. But Insomniac has a strict no-drugs policy that gets enforced indiscriminately. You are not safe from the law once inside the gates of EDC. In fact, there are tons of undercover officers dressed as festival goers actively asking people for drugs in direct and not-so-direct ways.\n\nI‚Äôm not going to give any advice about drug use or getting drugs into event. I won‚Äôt even say if it‚Äôs a good or bad idea. But I will tell you, if anyone that you do not know asks you if you have any drugs or know where to get any, your answer in all cases is, ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù\n\n7. GROUPS AREN‚ÄôT ALWAYS IDEAL.\t\nYou‚Äôre going with a group and for the most part you like a lot of the same artists. But one artist you really dig is playing at the same time as an artist that the rest of the group is going to see.\n\nPlease, please do yourself a favor, and remember that this is YOUR EDC too. Go see that funky DJ at Neon Garden. Cherish the time by yourself. Use your momentary solitude to stand in the crowd, close your eyes, and dance like you never would in front of those friends you have to see all the time.\n\nBefore you separate, though, make sure everyone is clear about when and where to meet up after the different sets are over. Be specific with a meeting spot. My group used a specific picnic table inside Carnival Square last year.\n\nAfter some of the full DJ sets got released online at sites like Soundcloud and Youtube, I searched feverishly for the sets I was thinking about going to but decided it was a better idea to stick with my crew and go with their flow. Christ, for every one set I saw with friends that I truly loved and was glad I did not miss, there‚Äôs two sets I wish I‚Äôd ditched my group to go catch. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I wouldn‚Äôt trade that weekend for anything. If someone offered me a million bucks to completely erase EDC weekend from my memory Eternal Sunshine style, I‚Äôd give them a kandi bracelet that read ‚ÄúGo Fuck Yourself.‚Äù\n\n8. SET ASIDE TIME TO TAKE PHOTOS.\n\nIf you have a Go Pro camera that can just take photos at set intervals then good for you. Do that. If not, dedicate an hour or two to just walking around the venue taking pictures of anything and everything. The creative directors at Insomniac jam so much cool stuff into the event that you‚Äôll need some time to take it all in.\n\nIf you go about it with the notion that you‚Äôll just take pictures throughout the night as cool or interesting things happen. Forget it. You‚Äôll be too busy having fun to take out your camera You‚Äôll get a few moments, sure. But in the weeks following the event, while you thumb through the photo gallery on your phone during the bouts of post-EDC depression, you‚Äôll be really dissatisfied with how many good photos you actually got. \n\nSome photos you should definitely grab, even though they‚Äôre completely unoriginal and literally everyone has some version of them are:\n\n\t-The view from high up in the bleachers at the Cosmic Meadow stage.\n\t- You and/or your group in front of the glowing EDC sign. (Your phone‚Äôs flash will suck. If \nsomeone in your group brought a good camera, use that one with the flash and make that friend send out the photo to everyone else.)\n\t-A shot of this year‚Äôs Kinetic Field Stage.\n\t-And a few shots of the EDC parade.\n\nEven though these shot are ‚Äúclich√©‚Äù (I‚Äôd  call them ‚Äúclassic‚Äù) the experience of getting the photo is worth it.\n\nI brought a ‚Äúgood‚Äù camera with me the first night. Went with the flow and didn‚Äôt get many good photos. I brought it the second night, dedicated an hour to just photography, got some good shots. Left it back in the room on the third night. I was glad to have the weight missing from my pack, and it was a relief not having to worry about breaking it. If I do it again, I‚Äôm only bringing my camera one night, and using my phone for any other photos I MUST have any other nights. Almost all my photos that are worth keeping were taken during that one ‚Äúphotosafari‚Äù hour.\n\n\n9. THERE‚ÄôS NO SHAME IN BEING AN INTROVERT.\n\nI‚Äôm an introvert. It‚Äôs not that I have problems being in big groups of people, talking to strangers, or being outgoing. These types of things just require more energy of me. Being the fun guy in the group was never my thing. And when it comes to being super-social I can easily feel drained of any life-force after just a few hours. In my daily life I often crave an occasional moment of pure solitude when I can just completely shutdown and think my own thoughts. I suppose as an introvert, putting myself out there is like speaking a second language. I can do it, I‚Äôm not the most comfortable, and I have my limits.\n\nNo one cares about all that at EDC. All that matters is that you‚Äôre enjoying yourself. If you‚Äôre in the crowd seriously looking like you‚Äôre having a rough time you can really make some people uncomfortable. So if you‚Äôre finding it tough to be wherever you are, simply remove yourself and take a break. \n\nThis leads me to the touchy subject of anxiety attacks. If you‚Äôve had one before you know how horrible they are. As a sufferer myself I can definitely see how EDC is a place full of potential anxiety triggers. I can also see how EDC is probably one of the worst places on the planet to have a full fledged anxiety attack.\n\nIf you‚Äôre alone and you find yourself feeling an attack coming on, get away from wherever you currently are, find a quiet(ish) place, and lay/sit down for a bit. I‚Äôd suggest an open grassy spot at Cosmic Meadow. Sometimes this isn‚Äôt enough. If your anxiety attack comes full on with all the usual symptoms, get some help. Seriously just ask the person, preferably the sober person, next to you for help. If their presence helps the attack pass then great. If they‚Äôve got good intentions but they‚Äôre really not helping, ask them very clearly and explicitly to get medical assistance. While the anxiety attack wont actually kill you, it may put you in a physical state where you‚Äôre more susceptible to injury. Being in the hands of the medical team is the best scenario. They‚Äôll understand exactly what‚Äôs happening to you and they can help you get through it until it passes. All medical assistance is free at EDC and you do not need insurance to use those services.\n\n10. USE THE DAY TIME HOURS TO REST AND REFUEL.\n\nMaybe you're 18 and you still have the energy of a youngin' straight out of high school. Maybe you've just turned 21 and you haven't had the chance yet to really rage, so you're chomping at the LED mouthpiece to get out there! Maybe you're well into your adult years finding a new part of yourself in the EDM scene. No matter who you are you need to get rest in between the long, hot nights at EDC. Depending on when you leave the race track, you'll probably get back to your room between 5 and 8 am. When you finally get back to your room, you'll likely just want to pass out. Drink a little water, then let your self crash into those clean hotel sheets. If your energy and fitness level is similar to mine, which is painfully average, you'll probably wake up around noon or one.\n\nWhen you wake up you will be hungry! You should take a few energy bars or high nutrient snacks to munch on when you wake up. Don't fill up on these, though. you need REAL food. If you're a calorie counter most of the time remember that your body will be put under a lot of stress EDC weekend and you'll need to eat more calories to get back what you lost bouncing to the beat the night before. I did NOT eat healthy, low calorie meals EDC weekend last year and I came back 5 pounds lighter. A lot of that was probably water weight, but you get the idea.\n\nWe all have different tastes. so eat what suits you. I had ramen, no not Top Ramen, real ramen from a good ramen bar two days in a row and it really hit the spot. I got some carbs, some protein, some vitamins from the veggies, and replenished the salts in my body. I also a drank about 32  ounces of water (2 16 oz. bottles) in the time between waking up and hopping in line for the EDC shuttles around 5. To make the most of those water bottles you should be gulping regularly, buy a box of Pedialyte powder packets and pour a packet into your bottle. They come in flavors that are actually kind of nice too. Some folks might recommend pouring the powder packet into a camelbak bladder. I would not do this. If you use a cambelbak regularly you already know how much of a pain it can be to get those pouches completely drained, dry, and smelling fresh. The pedialyte formula does have a little bit of sugar and salt in it, so now add stickiness and possible salt corrosion to the mix.\n\nBonus food tip: If you're road trippin' to EDC avoid road food. This is the time to eat good whole foods. I munched on carrots, grapes, sunflower seeds, and coconut water and after my 9 hour drive I felt great. \n\n\nOn its most base level, EDC is about one thing. Having Fun. The amount of production that goes into the event each year is all for a single end, that you don‚Äôt have to look very far or for very long to find something that will put a huge smile on your face. If this IS your first time, chances are you‚Äôll have a better EDC than most people in attendance. EDC will stimulate all of your senses fresh for the first time. Breathe it in. Have the weekend of your life.\n\n \n"},"5r4fsk":{"author":"FairLadyGames","id":"5r4fsk","created_utc":1485819156,"num_comments":7,"score":22,"title":"My Painful/Stupid EDC Las Vegas experience... or the lack of it.","selftext":"This is going to be a quite painful post for me because I still feel like an idiot remembering this story so please be nice in the comments. \n\nIn the beginning of summer 2014 after finishing my 2nd year of my Graphic Design bachelors and having absolutely nothing to do.. I decided to participate in EDC Las Vegas costume design competition. After spending a few hours I drafted a pretty nice [design](http://imgur.com/fQqb6Dr) that I was happy with and for the hell of it, I decided to submit it. There were only about two weeks left until EDC and I had completely forgotten about this competition until I received a call. Apparently I won. This wasn't some \"Hey you won a tshirt\" win, but a full blown \"A film crew will fly to you next week to document your work, then fly you and your friend to Vegas, pay for your hotel, give you full access passes (front stage, back stage, line bypass, meet and greet) and your designs will be featured on the main stage during the festival. I shook from the adrenaline and the excitement during this phone call. Little did I know, that was about to enter a world of hurt. \n\nIn few days we started discussing flights and documents, where I was to find out that because I was Ukrainian, with a Canadian permanent resident card I needed to get an American visa to fly to Vegas. With only one week remaining, the timing on the contest was so bad there was no way that I could get the visa in time. I cried for days, because being a huge EDC fan I knew this was a major, lifetime opportunity fuck up. The worst was that I couldn't blame anyone else but myself. The EDC management ended up picking a different contestant, whom they canceled on at the last second and abandoned the entire competition all together. \nIt has been a few years now but I still get an awkward pity feeling whenever I think abut it. So as a conclusion, kids, keep your documents up to date at all times and do not apply for things with loss in mind. Always be prepared. \nLuckily I was noticed in the local Toronto EDM community and had done some cool custom [designs](http://imgur.com/a/39eJT) for the past few years. Even got noticed by A&B! Maybe in a few years they'll open the competition again and I will try my luck yet again."},"5tv8p3":{"author":"Mourty1234","id":"5tv8p3","created_utc":1487017066,"num_comments":0,"score":1,"title":"Looking for EDC 20 Line-up Shirt...","selftext":"So as the title alludes too, I am desperately looking for an EDC 20 (2016) line-up shirt in L or XL.

So for everyone in my group, it will be our first EDC LV, most it will be their first massive at ALL. Because of this, I've spent the last year making a \"planning sheet\" that started off as just keeping track of expenses/a budget...but developed into a full fledged manual to our first EDC. I ravaged through this sub and magazine articles giving tips and suggestions, priced out as many things as I could, and used insight from my own experiences at raves and massives to create this. I figured I'd post it here and if it helps just ONE redditor in the slightest bit then it will be worth it. Keep in mind that, while I did try to go through and format this to a reddit post, this was originally form a word document so when I post this is might be a horrible unmanageable mess. This being said, if it DOES end up working out how I hoped, then I think you will enjoy the guide.

Going early helps a lot with this.\nMake sure you do what you want to do. If you get stuck with a group and are getting dragged around/they're being drama/stuck doing things you aren't into... leave them. Seriously. It's your trip and you deserve to experience it how you want to.\nDon't get caught up on little things. If you look for people who don't have a good attitude, you'll find them. But you'll also find plenty of great people. Keep a good attitude and don't look for negative things and you'll find nothing but the friendliest people. Someone pushed by you? Let it go.\nI've done a lot of festivals and those things can make all the difference between getting your money worth and being frustrated with the trip.‚Äù\n\n\n‚ÄúBest advise I could give is don't over plan your time at the speedway just go with the flow and experience new things. Also hydrate bring a camel bak and chapstick. Have fun fellow east coaster :)‚Äù\n\n\n‚ÄúAll hype will be crushed on the shuttle on the first day as you sit on the bus for 2-3 hours. But once you get inside the speedway, it's all worth it‚Äù\n\n\n\n‚ÄúI will be honest to you, every bad feeling you are having will fade away as soon as you get to the festival. My first year I was having buyers remorse, but as soon I walked into the tunnel, every single penny was worth it.‚Äù\n\n\n‚ÄúI came from New Zealand.\nTo be honest, before I experienced it, I thought the kandi/PLUR scene was really cheesy. In Aussie there's a few \"candy ravers\" but not kandi - if that makes sense. Not many people dress up in fancy outfits for festivals. The most you get in Aussie is the festival lad look (short shorts, no shirt, little sling bag). Most Aussies think its a bit over the top getting into all the kandi and fluffies and such.\nWell, then I experienced it. And, seriously, that kandi/PLUR culture is what made EDC such an amazing experience for me. People are just so friendly. The fact that EVERYONE is dressed up means that the whole festival feels surreal, not just when the lights come on the stages. Even waiting in line to get food is an experience! The people make EDC, and now I know why.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúFirst timer. I'd say for my experience.. Either come with someone that is more like-minded in tastes of music and are a little more big festival ready or come alone. My buddy that came with me only went to on show prior to EDC and it was just a small Galantis preparty for a festival up in Canada. He only lasted 1 and a 1/2 days. Don't try to cram too much in in one night... especially that first night. pacing is key. Don't be scared to talk to people. Man, was EDC ever a test for me. I've gone to festivals before and never had any problem talking to people... but EDC is on another scale. Eventually I loosened by the 3rd night and thank god I did. So many good people there. Avoid sunscreen (this one is directed to myslef)... first day in Vegas I used some of that spray on Banana Boat sport sunscreen. my legs swelled up like a balloon and turned super red. Quick life lesson right there. Finally Don't forget your ID. Almost ruined my Night 2 because of this. Had to shuttle it back to the strip, grab my ID and ubered my way back to the track. 2 and 1/2 hours laters. At least I got the bulk of the night in. Thank goodness.‚Äù\n\n\n\n‚ÄúI remember two years ago when snapchat offered \"Free WiFi\" in the speedway. The connection showed and the strength was good but couldn't send or receive data through it. Expect the same. Also, at times, back of Cosmic Meadows and right side of Neon Garden has cell tower signal (better than anywhere on the speedway) so could be helpful.‚Äù\n\n\n\n ‚ÄúA lot of people will be doing drugs. I would say over 50%.\nDrinking happens too.\nIf you plan on doing a substance for the first time, make sure it's safe first and foremost. Buying AT at event is always dangerous for multiple reasons both legal and medical. You could buy something you think is a magical pressed pill and it'll turn out to be meth.‚Äù\n\n\n\n‚ÄúYour best bet is to pick one spot that is easy to get to (in the middle of the speedway so it's equal distance from all the stages) and set specific meet up times in between sets or before a set you all wanna see. Don't count on being able to text anyone cause it won't happen.‚Äù\n\n\n\n‚Äú do not take yourself to seriously (Kind of goes with the no bitching rule). I love making friends but there are some people who are not use to the massive mindset/culture and are very reluctant to make new friends. EDC is not like any other event....‚Äù\n\n\n\n‚ÄúFor black jack just rememebr you're not trying to get 21, you're trying to beat the dealer. expect the next card to be a 10. if the dealer has a 6 and you have a 13, you stay. a 6> is a probable bust for the dealer. basically if the dealer has anything under 7 and you have anything over 11, you stay. if you have 11 or under always hit. if you have an 11 and the dealer has a 5 or 6 you double down. if you find a rhythm that's working stick with it. as soon as you get cocky and put a lot of money on a hand when you havent been all night, youl lose it.‚Äù\n\n\n\n‚ÄúLots of good suggestions in here. One I would add is, have a meetup spot at each stage.\nSay you're walking into Circuit grounds as a group. Before you wade into the crowd, pick a pillar, info booth, anything, and that's your designated meetup spot for THAT stage if anyone gets cut off. That'll come in handy if someone needs to go to the portas in the middle of the set - you can just look for them there when the set is over.\nDo that for bathroom trips too, if you take them as a group. All go to the same set of portas, and pick a spot to meet at after.\nAlso, having a locker is clutch for situations like this. My locker is always my drop-dead meetup. If it's the end of the night, and a friend is missing, the whole crew should head to the locker and meetup there. That way you'll always be getting together, if all else fails, at the end of the night to head back together. This is handy if you have someone who really wants to explore, but the rest of the squad wants to camp out in one place.‚Äù\n\n\n"},"647ove":{"author":"huladog","id":"647ove","created_utc":1491666608,"num_comments":18,"score":60,"title":"Less Common EDC Tips!","selftext":"I went to my first EDC last year, and I‚Äôm soooooo ready to go back! Thought I‚Äôd write a list of tips that I‚Äôve seen/heard, but are not the super common tips you read everywhere (hydration pack, pace yourself, dress for warm temperatures, use the buddy system, etc.). This is my way of coping with my excitement heh.\n\n**Ziplock baggie** - Made security a breeze. I put all of my belongings in a ziplock baggie and took the baggie out of my pack so security could just quickly look at the contents. The baggie was also helpful when I was rummaging for things in the dark. I didn‚Äôt need to worry about things accidentally dropping out of my one-pocket camelbak.\n\n**Wet wipes** - A word of caution, I kept my wet wipes in the ziplock with my phone and the combination of heat and moisture made my screen weird from water damage. It fixed itself over the course of the next month, but I‚Äôm not going to keep my phone in the same ziplock as the wet wipes this year. \n\nAnyway, as a woman who doesn‚Äôt own a [Shewee](https://www.amazon.com/Shewee-Extreme-Pink/dp/B00200LO7Q) (has anyone tried these? I‚Äôm thinking of grabbing one for this year), I had to sit when going to the bathroom. Okay, I could have squatted, but I didn‚Äôt want to piddle everywhere and also my legs wanted a break! Used a wet wipe to wipe the seat before, and then another one to wipe my legs after. If I could only bring one item other than the essentials, it would be wet wipes. Wet wipes wet wipes wet wipes! This is not a paid endorsement. \n\n**Ear plugs** - This one is more common, but it‚Äôs REALLY important! Some people love the volume, and it‚Äôs not as loud as some indoor events, but the music can get too loud for me, especially when you are near a speaker. Nice to have just in case, but bring extras since those lil things tend to get lost. Also, buy comfy ones since you may want to wear them all night, all three nights.\n\n**Go to the bathroom** - Even if you only need to go a little, you should start making your way over. I had a lot of trouble finding the bathroom each time I needed to go. The venue is huge so by the time I finally reached the porta potties, I REALLY had to go. Also, if you‚Äôre at the bathroom area, walk around until you find a free stall, a lot of people get caught up in a line near one of the entrance/exits, but there were always free stalls if you just walked around a bit.\n\n**Take time to walk around and explore** - I was so focused on seeing certain artists, I didn‚Äôt have enough time to visit all the stages and I didn‚Äôt ride any rides D: Before I knew it, it Day 3 and the sun was beginning rise! Gives me more reason to go back this year hehehe. \n\n**Emergency contact kandi** - I went with a group of 10 so it was difficult keeping track of everyone and moving between sets without losing people. Since we knew there was a high probability someone would get separated and lost, one of my friends made all of us emergency contact kandi! He typed everyone‚Äôs first name and phone number on a small section of paper and laminated it so our sweaty grossness wouldn‚Äôt ruin it. Shout out to you, Rachit! These came in handy since at least one person in our group used it to text all of us since he couldn‚Äôt access his phone and some strangers texted us for him. \n\n**Timemark texts** - Speaking of texting, service in unreliable and people might receive your text hours after you send it. It‚Äôs not as bad as I expected, but don‚Äôt expect your texts to go through immediately. Here‚Äôs an example text:\n\n10:15 I‚Äôm at Circuit Grounds with (friend1) and (friend2). About 30 feet to the right of the speaker on the right if you are facing the stage.\n\nMeeting up can be difficult and confusing. You can always decide on meeting spots for each stage ahead of time, but it may be difficult for everyone to remember.\n\n**Knee/Ankle brace** - If you use a brace of any kind, I‚Äôd recommend bringing it just in case. My knee gets sensitive if I‚Äôm on my feet for long periods of time. I brought my knee strap that I use when hiking/running and my knee was fine all three days.\n\n**Bring food** - Have some energy bars, vegetables, fruits, bread, snacks in your hotel room. After Day 1, I did not want to leave the room to get food. I just wanted sleep. Fortunately, we brought some chips, super moist Costco banana bread, and a cooler with some greens, fruit lunch meat and bread. You may not feel like eating, but make sure you do.\n\n**Stay positive** - Don‚Äôt let little things get you down. There will be things that bother you, and things won‚Äôt go according to plan, but keep in mind that EDC only comes around once a year and then it‚Äôs over. So don‚Äôt waste any time with negativity!\n\nOkay this list is way longer than I expected it to be. Hope it was helpful! :) See you under the Electric Sky soon!!\n"},"64upb9":{"author":"8Kneekirk8","id":"64upb9","created_utc":1491954960,"num_comments":10,"score":2,"title":"Chances of Bonobo playing edc?","selftext":"Do you guys think there's any chance of Bonobo playing edc this year?

My wife was trying to be nice and bought a backstage meet and greet as a birthday gift. Very thoughtful (she managed to sneak herself a ticket in there too!). \n\nThe show was, well, 90% pop (again, what did I expect). I swear I saw 20+ parents with children under 10 and more middle aged couples in button down shirts and dress slacks than you could imagine. As far as the show, there was a classical piano solo, an acoustic guitar solo, most of the songs were a full band, not dj'ing and, worst in my opinion, between sets on the giant screens they had advertisements going, not static pics but full movie trailers for guardians of the galaxy and some other bullshit movie. If you've thought they completely sold out yet, hang on...\n\nThe gift she got me was a backstage pass. If you've never been to one of these before it was like this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcUZ9Yi5sgU. We got in line for our \"meet and greet\" behind the 90 other people. They got through the entire line in 10 minutes, no joke. It was \"hey what's up\", photo snap, then security:\"move on\". It's a well oiled money making machine, I'm too embarrassed to say how much it cost. \n\nHere's how it relates to you guys. When we met them my wife said \"We saw you guys at EDC!\" Their response: \"What?  (long pause) oh you mean like vegas or something?\" No idea, didn't care, acted like it meant nothing to them.

You're going to EDC! You purchased your tickets and you have your box. If you didn't plan ahead make sure to buy from someone you know. I don't know how many times I've heard of people buying from a scammer. Do not use venmo use PayPal so you can protect yourself. If you are still going to wait and try to get your wristband in Vegas make sure it's valid by having your seller register it in front of you. It wouldn't hurt to ask for a pic of an ID either. There is no such thing as a single day pass. You are using a wristband that is registered to someone else. I would have your seller walk you to the gate to ensure the wristband is good. Trust your instincts when it comes to purchasing a ticket from someone you don't know. If it's too good to be true, it probably is.  \n\nHotel: \n\n*pack an ice chest \n\n*cases of water\n\n*booze(buy this before you get to the strip, it's cheaper)  liquor stores or grocery stores off the strip are best. If you wait to buy on the strip expect to pay rediculous prices. \n\n*solo cups and straws \n\n*cup o noodles(coffee makers are standard in most hotel rooms and will provide you with hot water) for those of you raving on a budget. I know it's not healthy but it's something and will help soothe your throat from inhaling dirt and ciggie smoke. \n\n*healthy snacks(bananas, oranges, beef jerky) pbj sandwiches are super easy, give you energy and don't need to be refrigerated. Eating is hard but make sure you do it!\n\n*emergen-c and other vitamins(tums, magnesium, 5htp, vitamin b) raveaid or any multi vitamin. Advil and pedialyte. \n\n*melatonin or treesüò¨to help you go to sleep. \n\n*portable speaker to play music while you get ready! If it's small enough, pack one in your purse or bag. it's great for waiting in line and grooving to music when everything is over. Everyone around me was grateful for tunes. \n\n*deck of cards(if you get bored and want to play drinking games or brush up on your card counting skills) to pass time while everyone gets ready \n\n*trashbags to keep your home away from home tidy(I can't stand a dirty hotel room and what will the maids think?!) Trash bags can also double up and become a makeshift ice chest. Just keep it in the bathtub and remember to empty it so it doesn't leak everywhere. \n\n*Sleep. You need it or you will become a crazy person. Trust me. Go to bed. \n\nTravel:\n\nI have driven, taken the shuttles and done taxi's. Hands down taxi's win. But keep in mind it's not financially ok if you have >4 people.  Taxis had little to no wait time and was about $60 each way.  Taxis also have their very own lane once you get near the speedway. \n\n*Drive only if you know you have a safe sober driver but even tiredness gets you. Pack water/ gaterade and snacks in the car for the awful wait to get out of the parking lot. If you are driving drop a pin when you park so you can find your car later and aren't walking in circles around the speedway. It is vast. \nWe also used Valet, it came in pretty clutch and we skipped the line and slipped the valet a $20 to expedite the process of grabbing our vehicle. \n\n*The shuttles are great to experience the excitement and new people. Every year the shuttle system gets better and better but be prepared to wait. Plan on walking a ways if the shuttle stop is not near your hotel, or be lazy like me and head to a cab stand for the rest of the way home. 30 min was the fastest we arrived at the speedway(we left by 4:30pm) don't wait until 10pm to leave. head there early to avoid the ridiculous traffic. \nIf you plan on staying til the very end be prepared to wait as well\n\n*DO NOT WAIT UNTIL AFTER 9-10pm TO LEAVE. You will be marinating in traffic. Leave early!\n\n*buy a drink or fill up a water bottle or camelbak when leaving so you can have something to drink while waiting for a ride. That morning sun is no joke. There are all kinds of vendors outside the speedway offering ice cold water and Gatorade for a buck or two(: There's a Sonoran hotdog guy as well! \n \nFestival: I live in Arizona so the weather in Vegas is comparable. It is a desert. It's a dry heat. Do not underestimate desert heat. \n\n*Hydrate\n\n*Arrive early for the first day! You have to see the festival grounds pristine at least once. It progressively gets grimier and grimier every day. \n\n*pick up your trash(they have a program where if you pick up and turn in x amount of water bottles/ trash you can score merchandise or even a trip to next years EDC! \n\n*savor the moment you step onto the stairs that lead you into paradise. You have an amazing view from the top! Just make sure you move out of the way of people trying to make their way into the festival grounds. \nThese are also the stairs you will curse when it's time to leave after dancing all night. \n\n*take breaks or your body will despise you the following day. Stretch while you're down there, it just feels good!\n\n*look to skies at midnight. You will see THE most beautiful display of fireworks in your life. Take it all in hug a friend or a stranger and enjoy. It is ALL for YOUüí•\n\n*hand fan and spray bottle. Be someone's angel. Fan those around you that need it too! \n\n*For the love of your feet, wear comfy shoes. Comfort over fashion, all fucking day. Those heels might look cute but they won't feel cute in about an hour. You will walk on average about 35,000 steps each night. \n\n*wear deodorant don't be the smelly kid in class.    \n\n*Your deodorant also doubles as an anti chafe bar. Rub it in between your thighs, you're welcome. \n\n*bandana to protect your face holes from dirt and cigarette smoke(if you don't) also hides thizz face. ü§§\n\n*earplugs. It's so important to protect your ears. Tinnitus is no joke. \n\n*sunglasses for when the sun comes up( this is important) everyone arrives pretty but leaves ugly(dada life reference)\n\n*crotch it\n\n*KNOW YOUR RIGHTS \"Am I being detained?\"  \"Am I free to go?\" These are phrases you need to be familiar with. Do not freak out and do not let officers bully you into admitting anything. I've never encountered a bad cop at EDC. They are there to make sure we are safe. Please be respectful of them and they will be good to you. They are just in awe of everything too. \n\n*Establish a meet up spot immediately. Preferably something that can't be moved(NOT THE GIANT DAISY/Giant daisy fiasco of 2014) ours was a fire hydrant \n\n*Familiarize yourself with the speedway.

Let them know!\n\n*Don't make it a priority to meet up throughout the night. YOU. WILL.  MISS. EVERYTHING. Seriously don't. \n\n*save the days schedule on your phones lockscreen. Make sure to change it every day. It makes it so much easier to pull up instead of having to pull out the booklet every time. \n\n*phones and wallets in front pockets. There are shitty people out there who steal. Stay vigilant. Remember to zip pockets and purses up. \n\n*Phone on airplane mode(service is real spotty) and you'll save precious battery power \n\n*portable charger if you can't bear to go off grid \n\n*time stamp your text messages ex: meet up at our spot at midnight(sent 8:50pm) text messages won't go through right away and you'll save yourself and your group from major confusion. \n\n*hydrate\n\n*take a couple of pics and video just don't overdo it.

He is one. Assume everyone is UC. Jk but seriously though be smart don't be a statistic. You HAVE nothing, you aren't ON anything and don't WANT anything. Procure your vitamins beforehand. If you decide to buy in Vegas make sure to at least use a test kit.

It's not worth it. \n\n*did I mention hydrate? \n\n*take breaks, it's very important to do this! \n\nAfter festival:\nThere are many day pool parties and events going on in Vegas during EDC week. If you plan on partaking be smart, drink water and take naps. Heat exhaustion and dehydration are all real. It is very possible to do EDC or any event sober as well! I have always chosen one day out of the weekend to do it. It reminds me that I love this music no matter what. #musicislife If you plan on partying remember rule number 1, Don't die. Rule number 2, you can always do more but you can't do less or take it back. So please be careful. There are medic tents everywhere. Have you ever experienced a hydrating iv?! It's glorious and free if you need it. \nYou can also ask for bottled water in the medic/first aid tents as well. *Its free(:\nThey'll have bandaids and headache medicine and a cool place to rest if you feel overwhelmed. These people are not there to put you in jail, they just want you to be well. \nInsomniac has volunteers in purple that are walking around and making sure everyone has a great time. If you need help look for Ground Control. They are there to help you! You will NOT get in trouble. \n\n\nI hope I hit all bases, this would've been my 7th yearüò≠ but it's time I venture out and explore other festies. Take it all in and pace yourselves it's not a race it's a marathon. If you see someone in need or acting a fool don't pull out your phone and record them, help them. You wouldn't want to be that person. You are in a safe place, if you need help don't be too proud or afraid to ask. YOU WILL NOT get in trouble with the law.  Trade Kandi, make new, maybe lifelong friends. Reach out to someone who may be lost, you could make their night.

Hopefully this is helpful to you all! Take care of each other!","selftext":"EDC TIPS \n\nTickets: Congrats! You're going to EDC! You purchased your tickets and you have your box. If you didn't plan ahead make sure to buy from someone you know. I don't know how many times I've heard of people buying from a scammer. Do not use venmo use PayPal or eBay  so you can protect yourself. If you are still going to wait and try to get your wristband in Vegas make sure it's valid by having your seller register it in front of you. It wouldn't hurt to ask for a pic of an ID either. There is no such thing as a single day pass. You are using a wristband that is registered to someone else. I would have your seller walk you to the gate to ensure the wristband is good. Trust your instincts when it comes to purchasing a ticket from someone you don't know. If it's too good to be true, it probably is.  \n\nHotel: \n\n*pack an ice chest \n\n*cases of water\n\n*booze(buy this before you get to the strip, it's cheaper)  liquor stores or grocery stores off the strip are best. If you wait to buy on the strip expect to pay rediculous prices. \n\n*solo cups and straws \n\n*cup o noodles(coffee makers are standard in most hotel rooms and will provide you with hot water) for those of you raving on a budget. I know it's not healthy but it's something and will help soothe your throat from inhaling dirt and ciggie smoke. \n\n*healthy snacks(bananas, oranges, beef jerky) pbj sandwiches are super easy, give you energy and don't need to be refrigerated. Eating is hard but make sure you do it!\n\n*emergen-c and other vitamins(tums, magnesium, 5htp, vitamin b) raveaid or any multi vitamin. Advil and pedialyte. \n\n*melatonin or treesüò¨to help you go to sleep. \n\n*portable speaker to play music while you get ready! If it's small enough, pack one in your purse or bag. it's great for waiting in line and grooving to music when everything is over. Everyone around me was grateful for tunes. \n\n*deck of cards(if you get bored and want to play drinking games or brush up on your card counting skills) to pass time while everyone gets ready \n\n*trashbags to keep your home away from home tidy(I can't stand a dirty hotel room and what will the maids think?!) Trash bags can also double up and become a makeshift ice chest. Just keep it in the bathtub and remember to empty it so it doesn't leak everywhere. \n\n*Sleep. You need it or you will become a crazy person. Trust me. Go to bed. \n\nTravel:\n\nI have driven, taken the shuttles and done taxi's. Hands down taxi's win. But keep in mind it's not financially ok if you have >4 people.  Taxis had little to no wait time and was about $60 each way.  Taxis also have their very own lane once you get near the speedway. \n\n*Drive only if you know you have a safe sober driver but even tiredness gets you. Pack water/ gaterade and snacks in the car for the awful wait to get out of the parking lot. If you are driving drop a pin when you park so you can find your car later and aren't walking in circles around the speedway. It is vast. \nWe also used Valet, it came in pretty clutch and we skipped the line and slipped the valet a $20 to expedite the process of grabbing our vehicle. \n\n*The shuttles are great to experience the excitement and new people. Every year the shuttle system gets better and better but be prepared to wait. Plan on walking a ways if the shuttle stop is not near your hotel, or be lazy like me and head to a cab stand for the rest of the way home. 30 min was the fastest we arrived at the speedway(we left by 4:30pm) don't wait until 10pm to leave. head there early to avoid the ridiculous traffic. \nIf you plan on staying til the very end be prepared to wait as well\n\n*DO NOT WAIT UNTIL AFTER 9-10pm TO LEAVE. You will be marinating in traffic. Leave early!\n\n*buy a drink or fill up a water bottle or camelbak when leaving so you can have something to drink while waiting for a ride. That morning sun is no joke. There are all kinds of vendors outside the speedway offering ice cold water and Gatorade for a buck or two(: There's a Sonoran hotdog guy as well! \n \nFestival: I live in Arizona so the weather in Vegas is comparable. It is a desert. It's a dry heat. Do not underestimate desert heat. \n\n*Hydrate\n\n*Arrive early for the first day! You have to see the festival grounds pristine at least once. It progressively gets grimier and grimier every day. \n\n*pick up your trash(they have a program where if you pick up and turn in x amount of water bottles/ trash you can score merchandise or even a trip to next years EDC! \n\n*savor the moment you step onto the stairs that lead you into paradise. You have an amazing view from the top! Just make sure you move out of the way of people trying to make their way into the festival grounds. \nThese are also the stairs you will curse when it's time to leave after dancing all night. \n\n*take breaks or your body will despise you the following day. Stretch while you're down there, it just feels good!\n\n*look to skies at midnight. You will see THE most beautiful display of fireworks in your life. These fireworks will ruin any other fireworks you see ever again. Take it all in hug a friend or a stranger and enjoy. It is ALL for YOUüí•\n\n*hand fan and spray bottle. Be someone's angel. Fan those around you that need it too! \n\n*For the love of your feet, wear comfy shoes. Comfort over fashion, all fucking day. Those heels might look cute but they won't feel cute in about an hour. You will walk on average about 35,000 steps each night. Try to wear wool socks or socks that will whisk moisture away. \n\n*wear deodorant don't be the smelly kid in class.    \n\n*Your deodorant also doubles as an anti chafe bar. Rub it in between your thighs, you're welcome. \n\n*bandana to protect your face holes from dirt and cigarette smoke(if you don't) also hides thizz face. ü§§\n\n*earplugs. It's so important to protect your ears. Tinnitus is no joke. \n\n*sunglasses for when the sun comes up( this is important) everyone arrives pretty but leaves ugly(dada life reference)\n\n*crotch it\n\n*KNOW YOUR RIGHTS \"Am I being detained?\"  \"Am I free to go?\" These are phrases you need to be familiar with. Do not freak out and do not let officers bully you into admitting anything. I've never encountered a bad cop at EDC. They are there to make sure we are safe. Please be respectful of them and they will be good to you. They are just in awe of everything too. \n\n*Establish a meet up spot immediately. Preferably something that can't be moved(NOT THE GIANT DAISY/Giant daisy fiasco of 2014) ours was a fire hydrant \n\n*Familiarize yourself with the speedway. There are maps and schedules being passed out when you walk in. \n\n*If you haven't done it already download the Insomniac App. It's pretty helpful and functions on airplane mode. \n\n*hydrate\n\n*sneak some crystal light/Powerade/Gatorade/pedialyte packets to flavor your water too if you get bored easily. Plus electrolytes are good for you. \n\n*i don't like lemonade but every single one of my friends swear by it. \n\n*get fresh watermelon from the fruit stand. \nYou're welcome. \n\n*pick a side of a stage to be on.

You will be notified within 48 hours if you are on the list and a map to the location at which you can pickup a wristband (and meet me and hopefully agree to a picture just for my own memories!).\n\nPlease keep an eye on the space and the sub if we open this up to more Redditors. We will have a few, discretionary wrist bands to give out at the event. Have your bribes ready! =)\n\nI'd like to thank the Mods of the sub for making this possible and out of the 500+ responses we received I'd say 80% of you took the time to write a personal message. I appreciate the love and am thankful we were able to have the opportunity to do a small kindness for you!\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nHowdy Redditors!\n\nSeveral days ago I posted that the company I work with, Buzz Pop Cocktails, would be attending EDC for the first time!\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/6fcm2c/first_edc_and_am_a_vendor/\n\nI was concerned that my post would be perceived as cheap shilling for our product. Thankfully the sub realized we wanted to offer you value with no expectation of a return in the spirit of EDC (of course we'd love you to try it!). I was blown away by the friendly PM's offering to try our product for no other reason than I'm a Redditor. I'm extra thankful for those of you who posted suggestions of what we could do to assist in making your EDC Las Vegas Event better.\n\n/u/Tm0ney561 had the most popular suggestion which was \"attitude free\" ice! I spoke to our CEO about the request and how we could make it possible so we are going to give it a shot! How will this work? I'm so pleased that you asked!\n\nStep 1: Please DM me your Reddit Username to /u/BuzzPopCocktail. **PLEASE NOTE** Cut off date to secure a wristband is Midnight EST on Tuesday 6/12/17. We have a **LIMITED** number of wristbands. I'm sorry in advance if we run out by the time we hear from you* but ultimately we are in the Frozen Beverage business which is where our focus must be!\n\nStep 2: Prior to EDC beginning I will DM you a map indicating which of our locations I will be at (there are seven). Come to that location at any time during EDC and I'll check my list. If you are on it, you receive a wristband.\n\nStep 3: Once you have received your wristband you can stop by any of our seven locations at EDC for free ice provided you are wearing the wristband. ***EDIT*** Ice is available all weekend as long as we have it! A friendly reminder to be considerate of your fellow Redditors and our customers making purchases! Thank you!\n\nStep 4: Be safe and have a great time!\n\nCaveats: This is our first EDC. As we have a frozen product we've been assured we would have plenty of ice. Please understand this could turn into a huge logistical fluster cluck for us and we are going to do our best. Please understand that ultimately we are a business. As such, if you would like free ice but we have a fifty deep line of fellow attendees making purchases I'd appreciate your patience while we take care of them. Filling a camel back with ice is NOT a quick process. =)\n\nLast notes: If you are an EDC Attendee and live in Vegas, please note that in your PM. Time is a little too short for us to host a party at our manufacturing facility but we are already working on exclusive Redditor ideas for next year. During/After the event if you try our product I'd appreciate any love on Twitter or IG. If there is an aspect of your product or experience that you didn't like, please see me directly at the event and don't be afraid to share your perspective online. I want to hear the positive and negative as it is the only way we can improve our product!\n\nThank you so much and I look forward to meeting you as many as possible! Thank you to the mods for allowing us to present this opportunity!\n\n*We will have a few additional wrist bands at EDC LV to be distributed as we see fit.

You're going to EDC! You purchased your tickets and you have your box. If you didn't plan ahead make sure to buy from someone you know. I don't know how many times I've heard of people buying from a scammer. Do not use venmo use PayPal or eBay  so you can protect yourself. If you are still going to wait and try to get your wristband in Vegas make sure it's valid by having your seller register it in front of you. It wouldn't hurt to ask for a pic of an ID either. There is no such thing as a single day pass. You are using a wristband that is registered to someone else. I would have your seller walk you to the gate to ensure the wristband is good. Trust your instincts when it comes to purchasing a ticket from someone you don't know. If it's too good to be true, it probably is.  \n\nHotel: \n\n*pack an ice chest \n\n*cases of water\n\n*booze(buy this before you get to the strip, it's cheaper)  liquor stores or grocery stores off the strip are best. If you wait to buy on the strip expect to pay rediculous prices. \n\n*solo cups and straws \n\n*cup o noodles(coffee makers are standard in most hotel rooms and will provide you with hot water) for those of you raving on a budget. I know it's not healthy but it's something and will help soothe your throat from inhaling dirt and ciggie smoke. \n\n*healthy snacks(bananas, oranges, beef jerky) pbj sandwiches are super easy, give you energy and don't need to be refrigerated. Eating is hard but make sure you do it!\n\n*emergen-c and other vitamins(tums, magnesium, vitamin b) raveaid or any multi vitamin. Advil and pedialyte. \n\n*melatonin or treesüò¨to help you go to sleep. \n\n*portable speaker to play music while you get ready! If it's small enough, pack one in your purse or bag. it's great for waiting in line and grooving to music when everything is over. Everyone around me was grateful for tunes. \n\n*deck of cards(if you get bored and want to play drinking games or brush up on your card counting skills) to pass time while everyone gets ready \n\n*trashbags to keep your home away from home tidy(I can't stand a dirty hotel room and what will the maids think?!) Trash bags can also double up and become a makeshift ice chest. Just keep it in the bathtub and remember to empty it so it doesn't leak everywhere. \n\n*Sleep. You need it or you will become a crazy person. Trust me. Go to bed. \n\nTravel:\n\nI have driven, taken the shuttles and done taxi's. Hands down taxi's win. But keep in mind it's not financially ok if you have <4 people.  Taxis had little to no wait time and was about $60 each way.  Taxis also have their very own lane once you get near the speedway. \n\n*Drive only if you know you have a safe sober driver but even tiredness gets you. Pack water/ gaterade and snacks in the car for the awful wait to get out of the parking lot. \nIf you are driving drop a pin when you park so you can find your car later and aren't walking in circles around the speedway. It is vast. \nTry and park near the exits as well for fast and easy exit. It's a further walk but it beats waiting in the parking lot for 2+ hours. There is no PLUR in the parking lot. \nWe also used Valet, it came in pretty clutch and we skipped the line and slipped the valet a $20 to expedite the process of grabbing our vehicle. \n\n*The shuttles are great to experience the excitement and new people. Every year the shuttle system gets better and better but be prepared to wait. Plan on walking a ways if the shuttle stop is not near your hotel, or be lazy like me and head to a cab stand for the rest of the way home. 30 min was the fastest we arrived at the speedway(we left by 4:30pm) don't wait until 10pm to leave. head there early to avoid the ridiculous traffic. \nIf you plan on staying til the very end be prepared to wait as well\n\n*DO NOT WAIT UNTIL AFTER 9-10pm TO LEAVE. You will be marinating in traffic. Leave early!\n\n*buy a drink or fill up a water bottle or camelbak when leaving so you can have something to drink while waiting for a ride. That morning sun is no joke. There are all kinds of vendors outside the speedway offering ice cold water and Gatorade for a buck or two(: There's a Sonoran hotdog guy as well! \n \nFestival: I live in Arizona so the weather in Vegas is comparable. It is a desert. It's a dry heat. Do not underestimate desert heat. \n\n*Hydrate\n\n*Arrive early for the first day! You have to see the festival grounds pristine at least once. It progressively gets grimier and grimier every day. \n\n*pick up your trash(they have a program where if you pick up and turn in x amount of water bottles/ trash you can score merchandise or even a trip to next years EDC! \n\n*savor the moment you step onto the stairs that lead you into paradise. You have an amazing view from the top! Just make sure you move out of the way of people trying to make their way into the festival grounds. \nThese are also the stairs you will curse when it's time to leave after dancing all night. \n\n*take breaks or your body will despise you the following day. Stretch while you're down there, it just feels good!\n\n*look to skies at midnight. You will see THE most beautiful display of fireworks in your life. These fireworks will ruin any other fireworks you see ever again. Take it all in hug a friend or a stranger and enjoy. It is ALL for YOUüí•\n\n*hand fan and spray bottle. Be someone's angel. Fan those around you that need it too! \n\n*For the love of your feet, wear comfy shoes. Comfort over fashion, all fucking day. Those heels might look cute but they won't feel cute in about an hour. You will walk on average about 35,000 steps each night. Try to wear wool socks or socks that will whisk moisture away. \n\n*wear deodorant don't be the smelly kid in class.    \n\n*Your deodorant also doubles as an anti chafe bar. Rub it in between your thighs, you're welcome. \n\n*bandana to protect your face holes from dirt and cigarette smoke(if you don't) also hides thizz face. ü§§\n\n*earplugs. It's so important to protect your ears. Tinnitus is no joke. \n\n*sunglasses for when the sun comes up( this is important) everyone arrives pretty but leaves ugly(dada life reference)\n\n*crotch it\n\n*KNOW YOUR RIGHTS \"Am I being detained?\"  \"Am I free to go?\" These are phrases you need to be familiar with. Do not freak out and do not let officers bully you into admitting anything. I've never encountered a bad cop at EDC. They are there to make sure we are safe. Please be respectful of them and they will be good to you. They are just in awe of everything too. \n\n*Establish a meet up spot immediately. Preferably something that can't be moved(NOT THE GIANT DAISY/Giant daisy fiasco of 2014) ours was a fire hydrant \n\n*Familiarize yourself with the speedway. There are maps and schedules being passed out when you walk in. \n\n*If you haven't done it already download the Insomniac App. It's pretty helpful and functions on airplane mode. \n\n*hydrate\n\n*sneak some crystal light/Powerade/Gatorade/pedialyte packets to flavor your water too if you get bored easily. Plus electrolytes are good for you. \n\n*i don't like lemonade but every single one of my friends swear by it. \n\n*get fresh watermelon from the fruit stand. \nYou're welcome. \n\n*pick a side of a stage to be on. Our group would always meet to the right of each stages sound booth if we knew we were gonna see the same set and were separated. This worked every. single.  time. \n\n*have a plan and let others know your plan but don't try too hard to stick to it. Follow your ears they know what they like(:\n\n*totems are great people finders, some people put amazing time and effort into them! Let them know!\n\n*Don't make it a priority to meet up throughout the night. YOU. WILL.  MISS. EVERYTHING. Seriously don't. \n\n*save the days schedule on your phones lockscreen. Make sure to change it every day. It makes it so much easier to pull up instead of having to pull out the booklet every time. \n\n*phones and wallets in front pockets. There are shitty people out there who steal. Stay vigilant. Remember to zip pockets and purses up. \n\n*Phone on airplane mode(service is real spotty) and you'll save precious battery power \n\n*portable charger if you can't bear to go off grid \n\n*time stamp your text messages ex: meet up at our spot at midnight(sent 8:50pm) text messages won't go through right away and you'll save yourself and your group from major confusion. \n\n*hydrate\n\n*take a couple of pics and video just don't overdo it. Trust me you'll never look at em again. And insomniac does a fantastic job at capturing everything. Live in the now and enjoy the spectacle that is real life! \n\n*Try and visit every stage\n\n*Avoid el pulpo mechanico. He and whoever operates him sucks. üêô+üî•=üò°\n\n*explore, all of this is for you!\n Go on rides! They're all free! \nGo check out some live art. \nvisit the art cars and side stages(artists will usually do a secret set there!) \ndiscover new artists, sit in cosmic meadow and talk to randoms...except the guy who is giving off the UnderCover vibe. He is one. Assume everyone is UC. Jk but seriously though be smart don't be a statistic. You HAVE nothing, you aren't ON anything and don't WANT anything. Procure your vitamins beforehand. If you decide to buy in Vegas make sure to at least use a test kit. You don't want to end up with PCP when you wanted ACID. #phoenixlights2017\n\n\n*eat and hydrate\n\n*if you plan on buying merch do it on the first day bc they do run out \n\n*cash\n\n*unopened gum, cigarettes and chapstick for three days. You can find these things at your local dollar store! Stock up!  Security will make you toss anything that is opened. Ladies this includes lipgloss and makeup!! \n\n*little unopened travel antibacterial wipes, baby wipes  and Kleenex. You can also find these at your local dollar store! Those porta potties get real grossü§¢\n\n*tampons even if you aren't on yours, someone will surely need it. you maybe be someone's hero!\n\n*asian trains are a real thing. It sucks but if you're trying to leave a stage or go further into one hop on and they will get you where you need to go \n\n*when moving through crowds make sure to be courteous.  \n\n*your face will hurt from smiling so hard so don't let anyone ruin your time and don't bother with aggressive people. It's not worth it. \n\n*did I mention hydrate? \n\n*take breaks, it's very important to do this! \n\nAfter festival:\nThere are many day pool parties and events going on in Vegas during EDC week. If you plan on partaking be smart, drink water and take naps. Heat exhaustion and dehydration are all real. It is very possible to do EDC or any event sober as well! I have always chosen one day out of the weekend to do it. It reminds me that I love this music no matter what. #musicislife If you plan on partying remember rule number 1, Don't die. Rule number 2, you can always do more but you can't do less or take it back. So please be careful. There are medic tents everywhere. Have you ever experienced a hydrating iv?! It's glorious and free if you need it. \nYou can also ask for bottled water in the medic/first aid tents as well. *Its free(:\nThey'll have bandaids and headache medicine and a cool place to rest if you feel overwhelmed. These people are not there to put you in jail, they just want you to be well. \nInsomniac has volunteers in purple that are walking around and making sure everyone has a great time. If you need help look for Ground Control. They are there to help you! You will NOT get in trouble. \n\n\nI hope I hit all bases, this would've been my 7th yearüò≠ but it's time I venture out and explore other festies. Take it all in and pace yourselves it's not a race it's a marathon. If you see someone in need or acting a fool don't pull out your phone and record them, help them. You wouldn't want to be that person. You are in a safe place, if you need help don't be too proud or afraid to ask. YOU WILL NOT get in trouble with the law.  Trade Kandi, make new, maybe lifelong friends. Reach out to someone who may be lost, you could make their night. Remember to take care of one another, be safe and be kind. ‚ù§Xoxo #queef__squad #azravefam\n\n\n\n\n"},"6gq8x2":{"author":"LiquidRazor","id":"6gq8x2","created_utc":1497244581,"num_comments":16,"score":83,"title":"ProTip: If bringing a CamelBak/Bag, put its contents into a gallon Ziplock bag for Security's sake and moving the line quicker","selftext":"I wanted to share my personal tip for those bringing in camelbacks and such with lots of items in there - if you put the bags contents all Into a ziplock bag initially for security to look through it, it tends to speed up the process and they don't have to fingerfuck your bag as thoroughly.

I'm not sure if this is like this every year since it's my first time doing shuttles, but I can't ignore the multiple instances where someone could've broken a leg, a brawl breaking out, and it felt like everyone was so close to busting down all of the barricades, rushing the front, and someone getting crushed/trampled.

What should have been a simple trip from Las Vegas village to the race track turned into about a 90 minute long shuttle ride because our driver got lost. Apperently the route into edc for dropping people off was not clearly communicated to our driver. This created unnecessary confusion and forced my group to miss not one, but two set's that we were drying to see. Sorry Illenium and Bonnie X Clyde. Maybe I can pay $500 to see you at a different festival.\n\nFrom there, when leaving the event, the lack of order turned what could have been a peaceful and organized wait in line into a three hour long chaotic situation. This was rapidly made worse by the staff, quickly causing the chant of \"bullshit\" to ring throughout the covered waiting area... there was no clear line, but instead a blob, that would occasionally get a water bottle or five thrown at it in an attempt to stiffle the riot.\n\nI'm not one to point out flaws without solutions, so if anyone in the edc higher up chain of command reads this, here's my suggestions.\n\n1) Fire whom ever coordinates your shuttles and the waiting area. Yes I am sure that many people can say they would do a better job without being able to follow through, but I can guarantee you that even a monkey with a few red bulls could do better.\n\n2) Hire someone who can organize large groups of people. By doing this, you will ensure order, organization, faster moving lines, and avoid a riot.\n\n3) Find competent shuttle drivers who won't get lost on their way to festival, or plan your drop off route in a more efficient way.\n\nThis should be second nature to you by now, but since it's not I'll waive my typical consultant fee. I instead ask that you get your shit together.

As these are my personal thoughts based on conversations with individuals including current vendors and staff from both EDC and Levy I wanted in no way, shape or form for this to appear to be an sort of official stance by BPC. I absolutely could be incorrect with parts of my insight but twenty years of business experience and my gut tells me that my conjecture is more accurate than inaccurate. Also, if any statements I make regarding financial or logistics numbers are proven to be incorrect I'll update them with correct information.\n\nTwo important points:\n\n1) Buzz Pop Cocktails not being present on the final day had nothing to do with EDC or Insomniac. We were specifically at this event by their invitation.\n\n2) I wanted to write this \"Bad and Ugly Post\" separately from my \"Good\" post as the good was beyond good and have amazing stories to tell about my experiences and the kindness of your fellow Redditors...which will also be much longer than this post.\n\nBasics regarding EDC LV. The Motor Speedway concession is run by Levy Restaurants which handles concessions and other items at various venues around the country. For providing their logistics expertise, if you are a 3rd party vendor, adventures include:\n\nA significant portion of the gross profit off the top goes to Levy for allowing you the privilege of being in their venue. So a $10 Product is a great deal less to the vendor before any other expenses are deducted.\n\nThey, understandably, keep a keen eye on inventory even if it means further dinging profitability. A pizza vendor told us that he had to buy plates from Levy at their prices even though those same plates could be purchased elsewhere less expensively. If you throw away a plate you are dinged as if you sold a full piece of pizza as according to Levy for all they know you did.\n\nBasically their contract states they can throw you out at any time for whatever reason.\n\nSo those are a few of the high points. /s\n\nWe certainly had a few adventures leading up to the event that had nothing to do with Levy. Our initial orders of freezers included several bad and incorrect refrigerators being delivered four hours late on Thursday evening. Not fun. However, other items were interesting.\n\nOur company is obviously named Buzz Pop Cocktails. However five of our signs said Buzz Pop and two said Buzz Pops. Not a mention of cocktails anywhere. Personally I found this a bit...coincidental...as we were located next to Levy run booths that had the word Cocktails prominently displayed. I can tell you on the first day that Redditors saved us as no one knew what a Buzz Pop was...but the line under the sign that said \"Cocktails\" was twenty deep at double the price.\n\nAdditionally our menu signage was never printed. Only vendor at the entire event from what I could find. When they \"emergency\" printed a menu for us it was dark blue on a black background. No one could read the menu to understand what products we had.\n\nThere was more but as I do not know what is going to happen post-event as a result of not just these but many other challenges I'd prefer to leave it up to whatever parties may eventually become involved to hash out.\n\nUltimately, around 2AM Sunday morning, we were asked to close up shop by Levy's Assistant Director of Concessions (I believe that his title) for violating some rule (not to do with the ice) that, in my opinion, was caused by Levy not doing their job. As previously mentioned I have to leave out specifics in case this becomes a litigious situation. Until that time, we were killing it on the 2nd Day. We brought in our own signage, created displays and of course the curiosity of other Headliners in seeing what Redditors were enjoying. Business was goooooooooood!\n\nSo. Where does this leave us regarding EDC? It is difficult to say. My gut tells me it is highly likely we will not be back...or if we are it won't be for awhile. The good news is we will be expanding to other Festivals and when our East Coast manufacturing facility opens, most likely in Florida, we will be covering the East Coast as well. In the meantime, apart from EDC, we are hitting almost all downtown Vegas events (locals see my \"good\" post in a couple of days for a special bonus for you), soon we will be in the top Day Clubs at Vegas...during EDC Week Red Bull was promoting a limited run of a Red Bull infused BPC's if you were at specific clubs and the response was amazing (Personally it may be my favorite tasting product we have made).\n\nI'd like to be certain to mention once again that we were at EDC by invitation of EDC/Insomniac and our closing for the 3rd day was out of their hands. In speaking with both Levy and EDC members on my belief is that Levy isn't that fond of EDC if for no other reason that they consider it inevitable that a death(s) will happen during the event at some point in time which indeed came to pass. Ultimately, it is an unfortunate aspect of running an event as large as EDC that Insomniac does require a logistics partner to  handle food/beverage/concessions. Unfortunately Levy has a monopoly on the Speedway which means, in my opinion, it creates the ability for them to not care whatsoever about the attendees or 3rd party vendors...in particular one that may have a competing product.\n\nBusiness and Investing have been my entire adult life. Real estate investing is my particular passion but occasionally a good startup opportunity arises and I see where it goes...and that has taken me around the world...to the pages of Forbes...and now to EDC. I believe that there comes a time in business where enough profit is enough and you have to put a little thought into people. Maybe I'm naive in believing that at an event such as EDC the concession group should be willing to not charge for ice and make  $100,000 less in the name of safety if nothing else. I, as many of the current batch of entrepreneurs do (more your generation than mine) understand the concept of Conscious Capitalism and the Thank You Economy.\n\nAnyhow...these are my personal thoughts and as much of an explanation as I can currently share to explain why we were not in attendance on the 3rd day of EDC. It will be very interesting to see how this all shakes out. While of course it would be nice to be back for financial reasons you, the Redditor Headliners, were amazing and I'd love to meet each and everyone of you again. I'm already working on a few offsite ideas for those of you who attend next year.\n\nThank you again for your support, EDC and Insomniac are awesome and if you can be patient for a couple of days I can't wait to share the \"Good\" report."},"6ip0b1":{"author":"tims20","id":"6ip0b1","created_utc":1498081096,"num_comments":9,"score":8,"title":"If you guys are really iffy about the EDC official shuttles check out One-N-Only","selftext":"This was my second EDC and not wanting to drive again, I wanted to get a shuttle and decided to use onenonly.

They seemed more like a group of friends who have known each other for years rather than people who just work together.\n\nthe only downsides for me and my friends were:\n\n\nThe drop off zone and pick up zone had about a mile walk to the venue ( i didnt mind, but the girls that i went with didnt like it as much.)\n\n\nThe other one was that there were only 2 pick up times to choose from, I my self didnt mind this, but since my friends take a LONG time to get ready. We had to take the later shuttle which wasn't bad at all. other than the slight delay for day 1, I would say that it couldnt have gone better if I drove. also the line ( if you can even call it a line) was short, atleast for me anyway.\n\nThey also have other packages that I didnt really look into since We drove to vegas and stayed with some friends.\n\n\nIf i was going to go to EDC again, solo or with another group of friends, Onenonly would be my go to.\n\n\nThanks again ONO fam for the wonderful edc experience and saving me from the hassle of driving.

So going into day one, I was hyped because I thought I was going to have a great time like I did last year but the Uber line was ridiculous so my friends ended up walking five miles to the entrance because of the surge of uber. So once we get to the venue we all immediately lost each other but then we found each other once again and it was a great time but after going to one set, we tried to meet up with more of our friends we all seem to lose each other once again. but ended up finding each other once we left at 300am at the taxi line. \n\nOn the second day we all had a great plan great setup for everything. once we all found each other at Electric Avenue we had a big line to go see the Duke Dumont set...then once we got closer and closer to the stage we ended up losing each other again so I spent an hour trying to find my friends then just said fuck it and went to see The Godfather of house music Green Velvet.\n\nNow here is where the lost love connection happened.\n\nIn the middle or towards the end of the Green Velvet set hours dancing next to this girl, Mexican, I believe short dark hair white T-shirt cut off, I believe while wearing fishnets and I think rocking Chucks too but I could be wrong. me and her locked eyes and then started dancing with each other for about 30 minutes to an hour. then her gay best friend wanted to leave but she didn't want to leave and I tried it get her number but my phone took a shit and couldn't save her number. so I'm hoping that she reads this and or somebody knows her and hopefully contacts me.\n we were at the Green Velvet set day 2 of EDC and if you know someone that was wearing that, dancing with a black man with dreadlocks please let me know cuz we were vibing so hard and it kills me that I don't have her number.\n\nthe 3rd day was probably the best day because all my friends didn't want to go which made me sad but I met some guys outside of the New York-New York Hotel where I'm staying at and we split an Uber there. we got there within 30 minutes and was by myself a little through the late night ;).  met great people to hang out with and ended up meeting this couple at the Excision set I believe and I was hanging out with them until we got back to the strip so basically the last day of EDC is the was the best part and I wish I would have done day 3 for all three days and not just for one day but I will be going back again and if anybody read this long post message me because I'm from California and I will be working at HARD SUMMER MUSIC FESTIVAL."},"6is0g4":{"author":"Jazminrbf","id":"6is0g4","created_utc":1498116936,"num_comments":0,"score":15,"title":"Missed connection","selftext":"It was on day 3 towards the end.

Overall I say yes.\n\nPerks of VIP:\n\n1. 4 different VIP locations. The one by Kinetic field was the largest. I never went to the Cosmic Meadow one. The Neon Garden and Kinetic Field one had air conditioned bathrooms. Sometimes there were limes but nothing more than 5 mins.  Bathrooms were kept cleaned by stuff and had security in front so guys don't go in girls and vice versa. \n\n2. VIP elevated Platforms. A special section to see every stage except for Bass Pod and Wasteland away from everyone else. Would be good if you like watching and listening more. I wasn't a fan because I like to be in the middle or from when I dance.\n\n3. VIP entrance. I only arrived early enough 1 day to really take advantage of this. But instead of having to wait in the cluster before the speedway opens, there is a separate line for VIP. I was one of the first ones in Saturday.\n\n4. VIP Ferris Wheel. Gave a great view of most of the speedway and Kinetic field. Shorter lines.\n\n5. Blind Owl Bar. Probably my favorite reason for VIP. Located in the Kinetic Field VIP area. An air conditioned bar with seats and couches to lounge and relax in. Had 3 waitresses who would get you food and drinks, but you could also order at the bar itself. The waitresses were great. We were there frequently enough that they knew us by face. Very friendly and attentive to your needs. Had a cheaper food menu. The portions weren't massive but they tasted great and were higher quality than chicken tendies.  Also had stripper/burlesque dancers who would chat and hang out with you and fan you. Overall a fantastic experience. We usually went there to relax and that is where we met most of the people during EDC.\n\n6. Miscellaneous things. In the Kinetic Field area they had Hammocks, a ball pit, Kandi making stations,  challenges to give to other people, a photo booth, a beauty bar where they so your hair and face paint, an oxygen bar.\n\n7. At the Neon Garden VIP area they had trash can beer pong, a couple different arcade games, big chess pieces,  jenga,  jumbo connect 4.\n\n8. Breakfast. At around 4ish every morning they brought out tables with trays of donuts, fruit, orange and apple juice, granola bars. All free. People were considerate enough to not take a ton of stuff so everyone was able to get their fill.\n\nPREMIER Shuttles. \n\nThe shuttles were hit and miss and I hope they do them better next year, but still overall good. I never left the strip on a premier shuttle because they didn't leave until 9pm and we wanted to get there earlier. \n\nThey were suppose to have a premier shuttle booth set up early to get a goodie bag of stuff for the trip everyday but they never set up early enough when we wanted to leave.\n\nYou could take any shuttle to the speed way. We took the Vegas Village one. We are suppose to get expedited to the front of the line, but the first day the staff didn't know shit about the premier shuttles so we had to wait like normal.\n\nYou had to wait in line for security before you could get in the fast pass line to get on a shuttlr. The security lines were 2 hours most days so it kinds felt silly. The benefit was that as soon as we got through security we got on a shuttle.  They needed a separate VIP security line.\n\nOn the way back it paid for itself. They had an air conditioned shed with couches and hammocks if you wanted to rest before you got on a shuttlr. The shuttles back were fast and took us to Mandalay Bay. We left each day around 4:30 and were back in our rooms by 6ish usually.\n\nOverall I'd rate both of them worth it. The VIP id give 10/10. Definitely going to do that again. \n\nThe premier shuttle is give about 6/10. Handled really poorly and the staff didn't know shit regarding VIP shuttles. It was nice getting out and back to the hotel quickly but the wait to get to the speed way was lame for the money we paid.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.

After taking a few days to rest, rehydrate, and collect my thoughts, I have come up with some criticisms and potential solutions. As an intelligent individual, I have found that by approaching problems in a calm, rational, and  solution providing manner, positive results can be made! If this post does find it in the hands of someone who can make actual change, and you would like detailed images and instructions on how to implement these changes, please pm me here or on instagram (@djnatone). By contacting and working with me I can garentee, my team of highly trained and qualified indviduals will gladly assist in making this experience more pleasant for everyone involved. This post will focus specifically on the shuttles because as you can tell by the other posts, edc itself was actually amazing.\n\nNow that I have probably lost most of the reddit readers in the first paragraph, let's move into the what went well with the shuttles!\n\n1) The staff was for the most part were very friendly! Despite the verbal abuse they were taking from individuals having to wait for multiple hours. This was nice to see, and helped to relieve some of the tension and anxiety festival go-ers were feeling.\n\n2) The water bottles that staff were handing out to those in line were a godsend! By doing this it ensured individuals would not have to leave the massive lines to refill and then have to fight back to their group to reclaim their spot!\n\n3) The misting fans also helped to keep the lines cool!\n\n4) Porta potties were easy to access before and after the security lines! This helped to remove the \"I had to use the restroom and I'm reclaiming my spot in line cutting excuse! \n\n5) the hydration station at the shuttle pick up stations heading to the festival helped to prevent us from dying of dehydration!\n\nSo now that I've patted you on the back, stroked your ego a little bit, and hopefully made you feel good, let's move into the parts of edc shuttle's that were less than desirable. These issues in my opion were caused by placing restictions on use the 3rd part shuttles, which normally would not be an issue when done correctly. Unfortunately, this restriction caused your mismanaged shuttle system to become over burdened, creating the cluster fuck of the first day. Here are some of the major issues that I saw which could have eased a lot of tension, anger, and missed sets.\n\n1) Problem: When I asked one of the shuttle staff who their manager was, I was informed \"I don't know, honestly don't think we have one here right now\". Now there are two ways this could go. Either the employee was lying to me, or there was in fact no manager at the Las Vegas village shuttle location. \n\nSolution: your staff should always know who their direct supervisor is at all times. They should always have access to a direct super visor at all times, and these managers should make their presence known to everyone. The best way to accomplish this is by giving them a different color shirt than the rest of your employees so they can be easily distinguished by the staff and paying customers.\n\n2) Problem: line cutting. Simply put, how your staff had the lines set up going to security and eventually to the shuttles was a horrible cluster fuck. Individuals took it on themselves to take advantage of your lack of organization and move themselves through the lines with no consequences from staff. By participating in this behavior, your barricades were disconnected moved, and ultimately rendered ineffective.\n\nSolution: instead of placing all of your staff at the front of the line, disperse then out to keep and eye on barricades jumpers. You can also manage to stop this by chaining garbage cans in the corners of the lines. This will prevent people from jumping at the corners, or unlactching the barricades to advance themselves through the line quicker. It also will save you money on cleaning up the water bottles just thrown on the ground while waiting in line because there was no other place to throw them.\n\n3) Problem: disorder / disorganization in barricade / line set up. All of your barriers should be set up to allow 2 to 3 people to stand side by side. I posted a picture on instagram of the 20ft space between the ropes which created a large crowd blob of chaos to be created. \n\nSolution: get a tape measure and some more ropes. Split the lines up better and provide some order to this choas. I am a firm believer in the philosophy of: organization = efficiency = speed  = order = no riots.\n\n4) Problem: Shuttle driver got lost on the way to venue turning an hour ride into a 90 minute bus ride. The driver had to stop and ask for directions twice. \n\nSolution: provide all shuttle drivers a map and make sure they know where they are heading.\n\nI have several more problems and solutions, but this post is already long enough.

However my friends and my brother who are all seasoned vets (have been going since the beginning) kept explaining to me that the shuttles have not been this bad in years prior.\n\nDay one, The 4 hour lines on the was such a vibe killer, but I tried not to let that ruin my night. We made it in by 11, missed a chunk of the artists that we wanted to see, but hey we were warned that we needed to go earlier, and we didn't get in line until 7, so that was our own fault I guess. \n\nHeading back that night, I'm grateful that we left when we did because some of my friends ended up getting stuck under the tents around 5am, and had to wait 3 hours for the shuttles to come back. I was told that people were passing out and whatnot during that time as well because the hot summer sun was already beaming on everyone. They didn't get back until 11am.\n\nDay 2, I had high hopes while we were walking up, we arrived earlier in the day and thought hey had their shit figured out because I didn't see the line wrapping around the block like I had the day before... needless to say I was wrong. Oh, so wrong. They turned the inside into a wide line cluster fuck maze which made it easy for people to cut others. I was seeing people who were way behind me suddenly 50 people ahead of me. What the heck was that?! Not to mention, heading back that night, they had us walking (what felt like) a full mile to get to the busses. There has to be another way, rather than to have us walk down two football fields worth of shuttles before finally being able to get onto one...\n\nThey did the same on day 3, but by that point I was just chilling. I didn't want to let the line fiasco be the make or break for my weekend. Although when I thought about it later, I actually spent more time waiting in line for the shuttles (there and back) than I actually did inside of EDC, and that was a mildly depressing thought. \n\nHopefully they figure out something better for next year... or someone give me some pro tips.

The color of the bus is black and yellow, not white like the other busses\n\n2. The bus is a double decker\n\n3. The AC doesn't work\n\n4. There's no \"Official EDC shuttle\" sign on the front of it\n\n¬†\n\nRegardless, we were all too excited to really care about any of these factors. So we start to head to the speedway and we hear people yelling at the front of the bus saying \"the driver is drunk, the driver is drunk\" but we also pass it off as people just being rowdy (we were at the very back so it was hard to verify anything).\n\n¬†\n\nWe start to near the air force base when suddenly our bus kind of slows down and starts to pull over a bit.

We find out that the bus didn't have clearance to enter the airbase or something similar, so they unload all of us off and the bus drives away.\n\nSo now you have about 40 ravers standing on the side of the road in 109 degree weather outside the air base confused as to what the hell is happening.

It was the trip of a lifetime. \n\nComing from a small, very conservative part of Canada, I knew that I wanted to explore a bit of \"makeup artistry\" as I went down. The Friday look was the galactic face - I was bored in my hotel room, sitting there with my astronaut tank and galaxy shorts on and then just decided I would try my hand at a space themed face paint.

The girls we went with mentioned how they were going as mermaids and I wanted to do something fun too! So I came up with the sea god look.

It's a bit slower than modern trap but you can basically speed up the movements. Here is an instructional video:\n\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=l9vLYEkMTc4\n\nIMO you can dance to trap at the slower tempo (\"head banging\" at 75 bpm) but you can also follow faster rhythms (like the hi-hats or other percussion or even synth melodies, not the kick/snare patterns). Which is what a lot of the more \"professional\" looking types are doing too when they dance - moving at the double time speed and not hinged on the slower kick/snare hits: https://youtube.com/watch?v=PnMnRMDoBXY\n\nThese guys/gals definitely switch in and out of styles/tempos a bit but I think you can kind of see the second dancer \"bounce\" her legs occasionally at the double time tempo and to me that's the dance style for trap that's the most fun/energetic. Ignore the crazy robot/arm stuff for now XD\n\n/u/Belleinoc /u/bitchimgeekin /u/nomar2003\n\nno, trap doesn't \"have\" to be about twerking, although you're welcome to use your hips if you want. Fast footwork and balance is much more interesting to me.\n\nIMO this kind of split \"slower vs. faster\" tempo thing applies to dubstep and drum and bass/jungle as well. For dnb following your leg/foot movements with the drumming tempo is [much more intense though](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2m_XP2Ih6Y), because in that style the it's the kick/snare pattern that is moving fast, and often other elements (bassline/melody) are the ones that can be followed in a half time sense. That 20-30 bpm change is no joke.\n\nThat being said, I have (probably poorly) taken x-outing concepts and tried to apply them to slower music (like dubstep/trap), and functionally it feels the same. It's a bit easier to apply bigger horizontal steps in slower music. Anyways enough rambling just wanted to let people know that you can dance to trap on its own merits ~\n\np.s.

I attended college during the mid-90‚Äôs in Gainesville, Florida which for several years was the home to one of the most popular, if not the most popular, rave scene in the Southeast. This was the result of one legendary club: Simon‚Äôs. For anyone interested this is a writeup by Vice about the club (and includes a great YT video from 2000): \n\nhttps://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/ypk9kk/the-essential-rave-nightclubs-of-floridian-history\n\nI myself was never into the scene which is odd considering my proclivity for late hours and enjoying the music. I can‚Äôt even say it had anything to do with being about as straight as it gets: No alcohol or drugs for me (although I believe all drugs should be legalized). Music I remember (and this will seriously date me): Rabbit in the Moon, Aphex Twin, John Digweed, The Prodigy and Delerium (Silence remix...still love it) among many others.\n\nI‚Äôve always done my best to be open to various styles of music but EDM has been a constant and while far past my prime of being ‚Äúhip‚Äù I occasionally pick up on modern artists in the genre that I enjoy.

Fun fact: A bonus of being thrown out of EDC this year meant I actually got to hear Alison‚Äôs set during the hour or so it took to throw us out!\n\nAn aside/old guy rant:\n\nScrew all you crazy kids with the 147 styles of EDM these days...I couldn‚Äôt tell you the difference between Trance, House, Dubstep, Grime, Trap or any of their sub-genres if my life depended on it...I know what I like when I hear it. Don‚Äôt judge me!\n\nAhem. As you can imagine, being a fan of the music, I know what EDC is. When our CEO called and said, ‚ÄúPack your bags, we are going to EDC.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt believe it. At that moment I had no concept of the scale of the event or what to expect outside of the music and that I was there to sell Buzz Pop Cocktails. So I did what any sane person would do and decided to see if there was a Reddit sub for the event which is how I found you lovely people!\n\nMy first week or so on the sub I browsed through various threads in order to understand what I should expect at my first EDC and of those who attend. A short list of my thoughts during that week of initial research:\n\n\n\n* WTF is Kandi?\n* WTF is PLUR?\n* They seriously do this in Las Vegas during the Summer? Oh...it‚Äôs at night. All Good. WTF it‚Äôs 100 degrees at midnight?\n* I can‚Äôt decide if I should be wearing more clothes or less clothes.\n* Seven stages? SEVEN STAGES? Holy shitballs, Alison Wonderland is going to be there? Above and Beyond too? Who are 90% of these DJ‚Äôs? Damn I‚Äôm old.\n* Why is DJ Khaled appearing?\n* 150,000 Headliners. Wow!\n* Who conceptualized this layout? Did someone drop acid and create a psychedelic, adult Disney World? Amazing.\n\nOnce my initial reactions had subsided I began purchasing items suggested by experienced attendees. Please allow me this opportunity to share some real talk with ya‚Äôll: Anyone and everyone who recommended a camel back you are a lifesaver. During our initial set up on Thursday I went through God knows how many liters of water in camelback...actually the first two liters was an energy drink we mixed back at the lab but that is another story.\n\nCamel Back Pro Tip: Don‚Äôt buy a camel back with a small opening. Purchase one that has an orifice the size of a red Solo Cup (aside: It looked like goatse when people were holding these open...and if you don‚Äôt know what goatse is for the love of God don‚Äôt Google it...trust me...I was ruined by the web a long, long time ago). The camel backs which completely unclip so that you can easily dump ice in (unless, you know, you are getting bent over and being forced to pay for ice...those jerks) is an even better choice in my opinion.\n\nThe other game changing tip I followed was to purchase ear plugs. First day of EDC I was fine. Second day...after the first minute of music...I was done. In went the plugs and all was good.\n\nWith my initial research concluded it was time to engage the sub directly. I have to admit a certain degree of apprehension when I initially reached out asking what we, as a vendor, could do to make your EDC better. Personally I‚Äôm very sensitive to being sold. I also understand how difficult it can be to convey sincerity via text. I wasn‚Äôt certain if the sub would react positively or jump on me (even though ya‚Äôll are a chill group) for being a marketing whore. =)\n\nFortunately for my feelings you embraced my dialogue with open arms and this is where I‚Äôd like to recognize one of your own. During EDC many of you thanked me for being ‚ÄúThe Real MVP‚Äù or for having the idea to give away free ice. While I certainly appreciate the plaudits if it had not been for /u/Tm0ney561 who made the initial suggestion of free ice none of this would have happened (well...we probably would have been thrown out of EDC still). The biggest thanks* should go to him and a further thank you to all of the sub members who voiced their approval to make his suggestion the overwhelming favorite.\n\nAdditional thanks should also go to your Mods. Being a Mod myself in a different sub that is relatively peaceful, though not quite to the degree of this sub, there are times we are approached by business interests. Invariably the individuals affiliated with these businesses want to take but offer nothing of value to the sub. I will be forever appreciative to the Mod team of /r/electricdaisycarnival for being open to not just hearing our offer but listening.  /u/CityOfChamps09 was my point of contact for discussion and I had the pleasure of briefly meeting two additional Mods at EDC.\n\nI should have surmised that we were going to ruffle some feathers when we were contacted by edmidentity.com to discuss our give away. It was about this time I realized what we were offering was out of the ordinary from what typical vendors do. We genuinely appreciate the kind press and for anyone who didn‚Äôt see the article, here you go: \n\nhttps://edmidentity.com/2017/06/14/buzz-pop-cocktails-free-ice-edc-giveaway/\n\nThere isn‚Äôt too much to say about the behind the scenes leading up to EDC. I flew into Vegas on Wednesday evening and from 8PM - 1AM was at our production facility assisting with labeling and any other tasks I could handle.\n\nThursday should have been a great day but ended up being complete ass. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, seeing behind the scenes as the stages and sets were finalized was interesting. The sound checks were cacophonous to say the least.\n\nEarly on in the day we were invited out to a nice dinner that evening followed by a VIP table at one of the clubs for a set by a DJ who was performing at EDC...I forget who at the moment. Red Bull commissioned thousands of one of a kind Red Bull infused Buzz Pops and were distributing them for free at several Day Clubs around the strip to a huge, positive response. Then the adventure began‚Ä¶\n\nAs this was to be written as the ‚Äúpositive‚Äù version of my experience I‚Äôll leave out most of what I covered in my ‚ÄúBad and Ugly‚Äù post. Apart from the glaring challenges with our booths our freezers were not delivered at 2PM as scheduled. They showed up about the same time as we were supposed to be going to dinner...and several were the wrong sizes, all were in poor shape and we outright rejected several of them. I had expected to have a good night sleep prior to Day 1 of EDC and ended up going to bed around 3AM thanks. Le sigh.\n\nSo the big day finally arrived. EDC Las Vegas 2017 Day 1. At 7PM an angelic chorus sounded, the gates opened and the Headliners poured in. The very first Redditor to stop by our booth was this nattily attired gentleman (please identify yourself): http://imgur.com/POCDbsl\n\nIn an interesting twist he was NOT the first Redditor to actually purchase a Buzz Pop Cocktail. Our aforementioned Hero had to go somewhere else momentarily and the honor of being the first Redditor to purchase a Buzz Pop (and the first Buzz Pop sold at the event!) went to another member of the sub...whose name I have misplaced (If you remember me telling you that you were the first Redditor to buy a Buzz Pop please PM me so I may give credit where it is due).\n\nThe first day almost all of our business was due to members of the sub for which I will be eternally grateful. I was unable to take a picture with every Redditor but I did have the pleasure of doing so with a number of you. If you recognize yourself in the pictures below and would like to be appropriately credited, please let me know!\n\nThe Real Channing Totem Crew (killed it with their totem). I showed our CEO this picture and not being very tech savvy he was baffled as to how someone could have our logo on a ‚Äúportable sign‚Äù.: http://imgur.com/mArUO0d\n\nLovely Redditor Couple: http://imgur.com/WEq51kM\n\nAnother Lovely Redditor Couple: http://imgur.com/oKimw1X\n\nOne of our Mods: http://imgur.com/oKimw1X\n\nAaaand Another Lovely Redditor Couple: http://imgur.com/oKimw1X\n\nSweet dodecahedron(?)

Perhaps the best example of this was the first time a Redditor attempted to give me Kandi. I‚Äôd never seen the PLUR greeting before and was trying to figure out if someone was throwing gang signs at me for no reason in the middle of EDC.\n\nThankfully, the two members of the Buzz Pop Cocktails crew who were in the tent with me are avid ravers, saw my confusion and explained what the hell was going on. I now know, without a shadow of a doubt, that I have reached middle age and will never be cool again.\n\nIn all seriousness the concept of PLUR, the positivity of EDC attendees I met (not just Redditors) and the genuine thanks from members of the sub we distributed wristbands to was an amazing feeling. I‚Äôll touch on that a bit more later. I do want to recognize and thank the Redditors who made Buzz Pop Cocktails themed Kandi and for those who shared Kandi of any type with me. My haul:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/BLOPoYf\n\nhttp://imgur.com/PIvTkCd\n\nhttp://imgur.com/bm5l7xl\n\nA couple of notes on the Kandi: All Buzz Pop Cocktails Kandi are now displayed in a place of honor in my office along with Yoda and a cuff I received. The Redditor who gave me the three owls could not have known how perfect those were. My kids and I are huge Harry Potter fans despite them both being under the age of five. They automatically associate owls with Hedwig. Having received three owls made for a very special gift when I returned home. I showed my children the PLUR greeting and shared an owl with each of them.\n\nSpeaking of PLUR and Harry Potter the first Kandi I gave was for the young lady who was kind enough to allow me to take a picture with her Deathly Hallows Totem: http://imgur.com/PIvTkCd\n\nA few other highlights from EDC:\n\nTo the Redditor who propositioned me...twice. When you get to my age I don‚Äôt care about gender, color or any other factor (outside of you being of legal age) I‚Äôm just thankful someone would still do me. So thank you for the ego boost.\n\nTo the Redditors who offered me (with LEO‚Äôs standing fifty feet behind them) a NICE joint...I don‚Äôt smoke but appreciated the consideration!\n\nFinally the big one: On Day 1 of EDC a Hunter S. Thompson lookalike stopped by for ice a couple of times. The costume and resemblance were uncanny. It was /u/Sam1Ron and on EDC Day 2 he outdid himself. After filling up with ice while wearing a huge Indian Chief headdress he handed me a hundred dollar bill and asked me to give one free Buzz Pop to the next twenty Redditors who came into the line. WOW.\n\nWhat made this even more amazing was that, prior to being thrown out of EDC, two other Redditors, /u/Hippotardimus and /u/LAF_NFJF each contributed more money to the Bank of ‚ÄúPay it Forward‚Äù. Absolutely fantastic and if you received a free Buzz Pop you should really take a moment to thank your fellow Redditors.\n\nEDC ended up being a very personal event for me due to /r/electricdaisycarnival and the Headliners of Reddit. I am, by nature, a reserved individual. I‚Äôve been complimented (accused?) of being impeccably polite and a touch on the formal side. Hugging random strangers is unusual behavior on my part. When I shared with my wife that I was hugging random strangers she asked if someone had put drugs in my drink. I can say with complete honesty that on night two, after continuing to receive love and thanks from Redditors from this sub and the amazing kindness started by /u/Sam1Ron that I choked up for a minute or two.\n\nAs everyone knows what happened on night two of EDC I‚Äôll avoid a rehash. What I would like to do is share the positive influence ya‚Äôll had on me after EDC ended. On my flight home I was seated in the back of the plane and a stewardess was kind enough to provide me with an extra beverage. I thought about it for a moment and poked my head around the corner into the galley and asked if she had heard of EDC. She said no. I explained to her what EDC was and then explained the concept of PLUR and Kandi and that I wanted to pass along the positivity I had experienced and presented a bracelet to her.\n\nI had intended this to be my final, direct embracing of PLUR due to EDC 2017 (although I intend to keep the concept for life now). After sitting at home for a few days and over the last few weeks as I‚Äôve wrote out this adventure I wanted to do a little more.\n\nAs my next to last (planned) act of PLUR for this is sub it is my pleasure to inform you that if you live (or are ever in Vegas) and would like to order Buzz Pop Cocktails we will have a list of your usernames at our Production Facility. Simply provide your username for a 10% discount on any pickup order in Vegas.\n\nFor my final acknowledgement of thanks and appreciation, although I can‚Äôt thank each and everyone one of you in this manner, I‚Äôve gilded the following users for the role they played in our ability to provide you with ice at EDC 2017.\n\n/u/Tm0ney561 (originator of the ice idea)\n/u/Sam1Ron (For starting the purchase of Buzz Pops for other Redditors)\n/u/Hippotardimus (For continuing to pay it forward)\n/u/LAF_NFJF (For continuing to pay it forward)\n\nI‚Äôm not certain how, when or where I may meet some of you lovely people once again but it will be my absolutely pleasure on the day that I do. Thank you again for an awesome experience!"},"72w3fp":{"author":"EdmMDE12","id":"72w3fp","created_utc":1506553736,"num_comments":0,"score":1,"title":"Line up","selftext":"[removed]"},"739po4":{"author":"Rmm05002","id":"739po4","created_utc":1506709493,"num_comments":0,"score":1,"title":"Quantum Valley line up for 2018","selftext":"[removed]"},"7d5251":{"author":"rafa7730","id":"7d5251","created_utc":1510761874,"num_comments":4,"score":1,"title":"When is the line up for EDC vegas usually released?","selftext":"I know it might be a little early, but I can't wait to know which artists I'll get to see.

Despite what people think of him currently, I can't blame him for playing mainstage sounds because he doesn't have much of a choice - he's on the mainstage.

Once you get your bag just head to the exit and you can't miss them.\n\n**What hotel should I stay at?**\n\nHere's some [reviews of 2015 hotels](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/3ohuir/2015_hotel_reviews_looking_towards_2016_hotels/)\n\n**Are hotels raver friendly?**\n\nIt's Las Vegas, they like everyone spending money!\n\n**Do I have to tell the hotel how many people are staying in the room?**\n\nThe hotels will say yes. Very few people actually do. Just have two people check in, the others stay back somewhere else, ask for extra room keys, walk up to the room! Hotels on the strip are massive and they aren't paying attention unless you draw attention to yourselves.\n\n**What do you do during the day??**\n\nEat. Sleep. Shower. Pool party. Anything you want! Don't tire yourself out for the next night of the festival though!\n\n**Insomniac shuttles? JusCollege? Taxi? Uber? Car? How should I get there?**\n\nYou'll pay premium prices for a taxi. Uber will be the same and expect some high surge pricing.\n\nFor questions on JusCollege shuttles click [these search results for previous threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/search?q=juscollege&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=year).\n\n**How long do the shuttles take?**\n\nOnce you get on a shuttle expect to be on it for anywhere from 30 to 60 mins in travel time depending on traffic. The earlier you leave to get to the festival the less time it'll take. As for leaving the festival, the first night/morning is always a clusterf*ck but usually fixed the next two nights/mornings.\n\n**Do I have to take the Insomniac shuttle I bought a wristband for?**\n\nGetting to the festival, yes. Leaving the festival you can take any shuttle you want. \n\n**If I drive, how much is parking?**\n\nIt's free to park.

Could be late May. Could be early June. Once it's released expect a ton of posts for it everywhere! In other words, don't worry, you'll find out almost instantly.\n\n**What are searches like going into the festival?**\n\nThey search everything. Ladies can expect their bra's to be shaken. Guys can expect their junk to be groped. Use your brain. If you have more questions visit /r/aves or somewhere else, we don't allow threads like this.\n\n**How do people attend the festival and pool parties?**\n\nThey are rock stars! If you attend a pool party on the Friday, Saturday or Sunday just remember that the headliner will probably play until about 5pm and you'll still have to get back to your hotel, get ready and get to the shuttle or however else you're traveling to the festival. This can put a big time crunch on things resulting in getting to the festival late. Decide which is more important to you! Being out in the heat all day will dehydrate you and tire you out more than you may realize especially if you include alcohol in your day.

Festival, shuttles, clubs, pool parties, etc..**\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/EDCTickets\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/EDCTickets\n\nIn an effort to try and keep the sub from continuing to be filled up with buying/selling we created a new sub just for this purpose! It'll also be easier to look for what you need without having to search a long mega thread.\n\nAny posts going forward will be deleted after a quick mention to use this instead!\n\n**Questions about buying/selling?**\n\n[Buying/Selling FAQ here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EDCTickets/comments/4ah996/edc_tickets_frequently_asked_questions/)\n\n**Is there an official ticket exchange site?**\n\nYes. Insomniac has endorsed Prime Sport - https://www.primesport.com/d/electric-daisy-carnival-tickets?utm_source=insomniac&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=ticket_exchange&utm_campaign=edc_las_vegas_web_general_admission_page\n\n**What's the lineup for EDC Week?**\n\n[View pool parties/club events here](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/4bodzm/all_edc_week_events/)\n\n**I can't go, how do I sell my festival/shuttle/pool/club ticket?**\n\n[Visit /r/EDCTickets](/r/edctickets)\n\n**How do I sell a ticket to a club or pool party? What about buying someone else's ticket?**\n\nIf it's a e-ticket meaning they sent you a pdf file just forward it to the other person. Be cautious and know who you're buying from because someone can just send the pdf file to others. If it's will call only that could be a little trickier and you'll probably have to meet the person at the will call office.\n\n**How do I get from the airport to my hotel?**\n\nThere's massive taxi lines at the airport and there's also shuttles that go directly to the hotels that are a bit cheaper. Once you get your bag just head to the exit and you can't miss them.\n\n**What hotel should I stay at?**\n\nHere's some [reviews of 2015 hotels](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/3ohuir/2015_hotel_reviews_looking_towards_2016_hotels/)\n\n**Are hotels raver friendly?**\n\nIt's Las Vegas, they like everyone spending money!\n\n**Do I have to tell the hotel how many people are staying in the room?**\n\nThe hotels will say yes. Very few people actually do. Just have two people check in, the others stay back somewhere else, ask for extra room keys, walk up to the room! Hotels on the strip are massive and they aren't paying attention unless you draw attention to yourselves. In other words, don't be loud and crazy and have security called on you!\n\n**What do you do during the day??**\n\nEat. Sleep. Shower. Pool party. Anything you want! Don't tire yourself out for the next night of the festival though!\n\n**Insomniac shuttles? JusCollege? Taxi? Uber? Car? How should I get there?**\n\nYou'll pay premium prices for a taxi. Uber will be the same and expect some high surge pricing.\n\nFor questions on JusCollege shuttles click [these search results for previous threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/search?q=juscollege&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=year).\n\n**How long do the shuttles take?**\n\nOnce you get on a shuttle expect to be on it for anywhere from 30 to 60 mins in travel time depending on traffic. The earlier you leave to get to the festival the less time it'll take. As for leaving the festival, the first night/morning is always a clusterf*ck but usually fixed the next two nights/mornings.\n\n**Do I have to take the Insomniac shuttle I bought a wristband for?**\n\nGetting to the festival, yes. Leaving the festival you can take any shuttle you want. \n\n**If I drive, how much is parking?**\n\nIt's free to park. Drive safe, drive sober.\n\n[View other tips on driving to EDC Las Vegas](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/search?q=tips+on+driving&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=year)\n\n**Any other tips?**\n\nA long list of ProTips has been written here: [EDC Las Vegas ProTips](http://thesceneisdead.com/electric-daisy-carnival-protips/)\n\n**How can I find someone to try and share a room with?**\n\n[View this Google document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bdHPyg0svpRFraDvoXWnEcl8K4RM3Mh4HLUJ0IX6XGw/htmlview?pli=1)\n\n**When will the lineup be released?**\n\nCould be early May. Could be late May. Could be early June. Once it's released expect a ton of posts for it everywhere! In other words, don't worry, you'll find out almost instantly.\n\n**What are searches like going into the festival?**\n\nThey search everything. Ladies can expect their bra's to be shaken. Guys can expect their junk to be groped. Use your brain. If you have more questions visit /r/aves or somewhere else, we don't allow threads like this.\n\n**How do people attend the festival and pool parties?**\n\nThey are rock stars! If you attend a pool party on the Friday, Saturday or Sunday just remember that the headliner will probably play until about 5pm and you'll still have to get back to your hotel, get ready and get to the shuttle or however else you're traveling to the festival. This can put a big time crunch on things resulting in getting to the festival late. Decide which is more important to you! Being out in the heat all day will dehydrate you and tire you out more than you may realize especially if you include alcohol in your day. Be smart!\n\n**How do I meet people?**\n\nThere'll be ravers everywhere!! You won't be able to miss them. Just say hi.\n\nAny more suggestions to add to this?

Maybe JoC just put down the 17th as a general date since that's when EDC begins? Maybe Aly & Fila fly back after the Atlanta set and arrives in Vegas in time for the sunrise set on Friday? Maybe Dreamstate gets an entire stage for themselves for the entire weekend (probably not)?\n\nSince last year's Sunday lineup at Circuit Grounds was trance, I assumed they would do the exact same thing this year and just throw the Dreamstate label over it.

He played EDC LV in 2012, 2013, and did not play in 2014, 2015 I believe correct me if I'm wrong.  Last year in 2015, he played Marquee thursday and sunday daytime (but wasn't at the festival, wtf.  Why not play both events, EDC at late night / morning or as a surprise guest appearance, weird).   Everybody thought for sure 100% if an artist is already in town for Vegas club = Automatic YES they playing EDC.  Now we know that isn't always completely true.   Exclusitivity contracts to the clubs? conflict of contract? playing at hard festival a month later? They're both under the Livenation umbrella, makes sense to have most people playing at Hard, won't be at EDC.  Lineup difference is noticeable.  Any other possible reasons?\n\n¬†\n\nThere is one loophole.  Dilion francis NOT being on the EDC 2015 lineup.  He played Hard summer a month later.  He actually was the * surprise guest appearance * at EDC 2015, closing out Cosmic Meadows stage, when the sun was coming up.  I wonder if that loophole will happen again this year at EDC 2016 with a different artist.  Artist is on the Hard summer lineup, NOT on the EDC lineup, but will end up as as surprise guest appearance and shock everyone cause people didn't expect that person to be at EDC.  We'll see.\n\n¬†\n\nThis year, 2016 :\n\n1. Major Lazer, Diplo playing @ Encore beach club one day before EDC starts on Thursday June 16\n2. Flosstradamus is also playing @ Encore beach club on Thursday but have confirmed to the public they will not be at EDC\n3. Skrillex playing @ Surrender on Wed, 2 days before the music festival\n\n¬†\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong on dates ill update it.  It would be a total shock if these 2 played vegas clubs so close to the EDC date, but don't show up at the BIGGEST most-stacked lineup edm music festival in North America?!?  140,000 attendees per day.  And where hundreds of DJs, *most* of the big names will be there.  People's would be in disblief thinking WTF seriously.\n\n¬†\n\nAny other artists who play Vegas clubs near the festival date, same week, or a day before but do not show up at the festival? aside from the ones I listed.

But the lineup drop today is getting me excited.\n\nHow do DJs (or their staff) change their mixing and lights/effects equipment so quickly between sets?  I assume each DJ is using his/her own equipment as it's what they would practice on.  But switching out everything AND doing some sanity tests in a 5-minute break between sets sounds insanely difficult, even with a full rehearsal earlier in the day.\n\nOR is there just a single set of equipment at the podium all night and DJs just plug in their laptops and maybe a couple peripherals?  Looking at pictures from EDCNY I'm seeing all sorts of equipment up there, it looks like it belongs to the DJs rather than the festival/promoter/affiliate.\n\nThanks!

I'm looking forward to EDC so much it's insane. But all this hate towards the lineup is sad to see.\n\nCan we not recognize the uniqueness of this lineup? Ultra, TMW, Creamfields, etc. will all pretty much have the same lineups +/- a few guys. EDC is stacked with variety, top names both new and old.\n\nI think Insomniac nailed it. It's a pretty diverse lineup when it comes to sub-genres. But, there are some people on this lineup I would have never even thought of seeing at a big festival like this. (Or ever really, I can't find a single set online for some of the guys I've been looking up)\n\nKDrew? I've got like 10 of his songs in the early stages of my playlist that now has almost 500 songs in it. I flipped my shit when I heard his song in the stage mixes on night owl radio having not listened to him in awhile.  There are so many classic guys that haven't played in awhile, or a new people coming up that are going to be playing. I could give more examples like KDrew, but you guys get the jist of it, and I'm sure everybody has their own similar artist. \n\nIt's not like the top end of the lineup is lacking either. Pendulum?  Paul Van Dyk return? Stacked Sunday @ Dreamstate? Like, wat.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I'm sad not seeing a few people. I don't think you understand how much I wanted to be there for when Showtek played 'Slow Down'. I've dreamed of that moment for yearssssssssssssssssssss.    But this lineup is spectacular and Showtek + every other massive name \"missing\" will be back eventually.\n\nAlso, I've never even been to EDC but even I know it's not all about the music and the lineup. The stages, the atmosphere, the vibes, etc. I think all of that will be better than ever before, even with the \"lack luster\" lineup.\n\n+ there is still that unannounced 1%   I don't want to get my hopes up, but there is the potential for some bigggggggggggggg names to be playing as surprise guests.\n\n24 days, 4 hours, and 30 minutes until the gates open..... see you guys soon <3"},"4kwef2":{"author":"Philphil89","id":"4kwef2","created_utc":1464127964,"num_comments":4,"score":5,"title":"Now that we have the lineup...","selftext":"All I keep doing is checking my email every hour for my tracking number.

I will probably poke my head in at basspod, 7up, NG and the UDH stages though for a little bit."},"4nauga":{"author":"JayThaBird","id":"4nauga","created_utc":1465479822,"num_comments":0,"score":9,"title":"Day by Day Lineup FULL"},"4nbioz":{"author":"TheHans215","id":"4nbioz","created_utc":1465488756,"num_comments":37,"score":20,"title":"Anybody else hoping they release set times earlier?","selftext":"I know they usually release them closer to the event but since it's the 20th anniversary and the lineup is so stacked with names, I'm hoping we get set times earlier.

This information remained consistent this whole time. We called Frontgate to find out what was going on and it turns out that they were not even going to ship my tickets at all due to some error they are just now coming to terms with. If you are not leaving until Thursday, and you would rather receive your ticket by mail instead of will call, I recommend giving them a call today. The representative said that they are switching it over to overnight shipping so I should receive my package tomorrow or Wednesday. Hopefully this helps someone that was in the same boat as I was.  \n\nEdit: So at this point I believe that the redditor who hypothesized today's lineup announcement was just a way to distract from the ticket problems was correct. Unlike what was stated on twitter, the mailman came and left with no tickets today. Fortunately, I did receive my overnight shipping confirmation e-mail a few hours after having the original conversation with Frontgate. The e-mail states that I should receive my tickets tomorrow. If you are wondering, the e-mail was straight from UPS, not Frontgate. Once again, if you are in the same situation as I was, I hope this post helps because it sort of goes against what most people are saying. \nHere is the phone number I called, just in case you don't feel like digging through the comments: (512) 389-0315"},"4nwmxq":{"author":"djbayko","id":"4nwmxq","created_utc":1465837883,"num_comments":18,"score":0,"title":"No Secret Guests?","selftext":"I didn't do an exhaustive search, but I didn't find any secret guests in the latest app?

I ventured solo for a good chunk of the night, but at most sets I was easily bored. I couldn't really stand there and dance for the entirety of a full set. I'd go to a stage, stay for a little bit, then get bored and try to move on to a different stage.\n\nIt also felt like I wasn't feeding off any vibes from the crowd either. There weren't assholes, but it seemed like everyone was just keeping to themselves and weren't really social or friendly. As someone who is normally shy when he's not with people he's familiar with, it made it really hard to play off of \"good vibes\" when there really wasn't vibes to play off of.\n\nI don't know what it was, but I left Day 1 just feeling less than satisfied, when compared to other local events I've been to in the Bay Area. I was really excited to see Kaskade's set, for instance, but the crowd seemed kind of bored and I ended up getting bored of his set quickly.\n\nIt might be that some of the lineup didn't really mesh well with my own personal tastes. My tastes have lately shifted towards just more \"feel-good/happy/lighthearted\" music like pure house, deep house, nu disco,  and some \"progressive\" house like Arty and Audien. My favorite moment was hearing All Cried Out during SNBRN B2B Dr. Fresch, but there really weren't too many highlights today. \n\nIf I'm being honest, EDC Day 1 was one of the more boring events I've been to, and I really don't want Day 2 and 3 to feel the same way."},"4orrbl":{"author":"mr10am","id":"4orrbl","created_utc":1466307740,"num_comments":135,"score":20,"title":"2016 EDCLV Day 2 Live Stream Discussion Thread","selftext":"**Stream Links(11:30 pm ET until 8:30 am ET - rebroadcast begins immediately after live stream ends)**\n\n**YT:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqcz_lvNYPM\n**Twitch:** https://www.twitch.tv/edclv2016\n\n**Day 2 Lineup:**\n\n* 4B\n* Above & Beyond\n* Adaro\n* Alison Wonderland\n* A-Trak\n* Anna Lunoe\n* Axwell ^ Ingrosso\n* Bioweapon\n* Brennan Heart\n* Dash Berlin\n* Da Tweekaz\n* Digital Punk\n* Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike\n* Ephwurd\n* Gunz For Hire\n* MAKJ\n* Martin Garrix\n* Max Enforcer\n* Paper Diamond\n* Seven Lions\n* Shiba San\n* Slander\n* Stephanie\n* Tommy Trash\n* TNT\n\n**Set Times for artists (circled) performing today (credit to /u/Sentrolyx):** http://i.imgur.com/lyTVJN5.png"},"4owdoj":{"author":"mr10am","id":"4owdoj","created_utc":1466388219,"num_comments":174,"score":10,"title":"2016 EDCLV Day 3 Live Stream Discussion Thread","selftext":"It's the last day my fellow reddit ravers!!!!\n\n**Stream Links:**\n\n* **YT:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdDQz4S_WDA\n* **Twitch:** https://www.twitch.tv/edclv2016\n\n**Day 3 Lineup (11:30 pm ET until 8:30 am ET - rebroadcast begins immediately after live stream ends):**\n\n* Aly & Fila\n* Astrix B2B Ace Ventura\n* Brookes Brothers B2B Cyantific B2B Inside Info B2B The Prototypes\n* Brillz\n* Carnage\n* Culture Shock\n* Danny Howard\n* Delta Heavy\n* Dimension\n* Doctor P B2B Cookie Monsta B2B Funtcase\n* Ferry Corsten Presents Gouryella\n* Galantis\n* Gareth Emery\n* Hannah Wants\n* Hermitude\n* John Askew\n* Joyryde\n* Kasra B2B Mefjus\n* Loudpvck\n* Marshmello\n* Maximono\n* Markus Schulz\n* Paul Oakenfold\n* RL Grime\n* Tiesto\n* Troyboi\n* Valentino Khan\n* What So Not\n* Yellow Claw\n* Zomboy\n\n**Set times for livestream artists:** http://i.imgur.com/kHl3ILE.png"},"4ozaq8":{"author":"AV-on-Reddit","id":"4ozaq8","created_utc":1466436739,"num_comments":12,"score":6,"title":"Has anyone heard any news about the audio glitches at Circuit Grounds?","selftext":"I heard the audio cut out for like one second at a time, multiple times, during both Above & Beyond and Gareth Emery.

Last year was my first EDC & I did VIP. In my opinion it's TOTALLY worth it, I just  don't have the money this year so I'm doing GA but here was my experience:\n\nJust to do a little review for anyone who wants to know (I'll probably repost this into the EDC sub also):\n\nRapid entry: This is like 70% of the reason I'm saying is worth it. It was sooo nice getting into the speedway in like 20 min while it took everyone else a couple hours, I'm reaaally dreading that this year... The only plus is that I can imagine it's MUCH more impressive walking into the speedway at night than it is during the day.\n\nPhoto booths / body painting / photo-op: I didn't really use any of this. It's a nice addition but obviously don't base your decision on this.\n\nPrivate ferris wheel & ball pit: These were amazing haha. Another reason I'm considering doing it again. People say the ferris wheel is a waste of time, but being up there above everything (especially at the one in Kinetic Field looking down on that mass of people & the incredible stage) is a completely magical unmatched feeling. Kinetic's VIP wheel has an incredible view no one else will have, with a 10 min wait tops as opposed to the huge lines the rest of them have. When I was on it on the second night we were on it for almost the entire fireworks show, still one of the best memories I have. The ball pit's awesome, nuff said. We started a fight in there one night throwing the balls at each other & people kept jumping in & joining, another favorite memory haha. I did lose my GoPro bag in there though but found it eventually, super freakout moment.\n\nDrink tickets: Eh... They're tricky with this one. First night was actually a cocktail (one of 2 choices), second night was just a coconut water, don't remember what the last night was.\n\nWifi/Charging stations: My phone didn't fit in my bag so I didn't take it in, didn't even look for these.\n\nLaminate/Lanyard: This thing is awesome, still one of my prized possessions from the weekend & it has all the set times on it which is super convenient cause it's hanging around your neck & you don't have to pull out your phone to check them. Obviously this alone isn't worth the extra $350 but it's a great extra.\n\nPrivate bathrooms: These are not porta-potty's. They're actually pretty nice, lighted, air-conditioned trailers with a sink, soap, & a mirror. Soo much better. But just so you know, the GA porta potty's behind Kinetic Field never had a line. So if you don't mind porta-potty's & you're just wanting it to avoid the line, it's not worth it. Circuit Grounds VIP didn't even have any bathrooms (or I'm just blind & didn't see them).\n\nI might've forgotten some stuff so go ahead & ask me! Also for those of you who have done VIP, if I'm inaccurate on anything let me know please. See you guys under the electric sky :D YESTERDAY MARKED 3 MONTHS TO GO!!!\n\nEDIT: Read the comments for more info people are adding! Turning into a pretty informative thread, which is what I aimed for so I hope this is helping people :) Merch booth, food, & drink also in VIP was great if they had what you wanted, super short line (if any) but it was a much smaller selection. Also this is crucial, if you do VIP don't use it as a way to exclude yourself from the GA crowd. When I went we kinda treated VIP as a place to chill in between sets, which kinda takes away from it. It's an amazing viewing area & great when you can't make it into the GA area cause it's too packed, but I regret not being in the GA crowd with all the crazy people as much. Nothing compares to that experience & you meet more people that way. I guess it's personal preference but I'll say this: Some of the VIP people are great, but for the most part they're not as hyped, which kinda bummed me out personally but again it depends on your preference. & By \"not as hyped\" I mean I constantly saw people who were standing at the front of the VIP & just texting, not singing or dancing or anything. With such a bored look on their face.

Those times are approximate but since we have 3 15 passenger vans we have some leeway with times and getting everyone there and back when they want. \n\nWe drop off and pick up in the designated PU/DO lot at the LV Motor Speedway (Usually lot #4 on Las Vegas Blvd) and get in and out really fast. Our base is at Mandalay Bay so we try to have as many people as we can meet up with us there if they are staying nearby and then we make 2 or 3 other stops to pick up people when it's not convenient for them to get to Mandalay. We also do pickups/dropoffs downtown or off the strip. On the way back we drop everyone off at their individual hotels since everyone is tired and just wants to get back to their hotel ASAP. We charge $25 per person each way, ($150 for roundtrip service all 3 days) if we bring you to the speedway from the strip then you are guaranteed a ride back with us as long as the ride back is paid for when we meet up to take you to EDC. We don't offer just rides back to the strip from EDC, ROUNDTRIP SERVICE ONLY. We started pre booking and reservations about 2 months ago, as of now we are about 60% booked. We take a deposit thru Paypal and then you can pay us the balance the first day we pick you up. This year will be our 6th year running our EDC Las Vegas shuttles. Most of the people that come with us are repeat riders from previous years, friends and friends of friends and fellow Redditors. Last year we transported a lot of Redditors and a lot of them are coming with us again this year. With us there is no waiting around for hours in lines to get to EDC or hours waiting in lines to get back to your hotel after EDC and unlike the official shuttles where you must take it from a specific hotel and back to the same hotel we will pick you up at whichever hotel you want and take you back to what ever hotel you want to go to. We consider ourselves an express shuttle service with VIP service since we prebook everyone and you know your pickup times in advance and don't have to stand around for hours waiting in line to get on a shuttle. If you decide you want to leave earlier then planned just text me or one of my other 2 drivers and you can hop on an earlier shuttle, we're pretty lenient in that regard, our main goal is to make sure everyone gets to and from EDC in a safe and fun manner and that everyone makes it home in the morning. We blast EDM music the whole way to get everyone in the mood for the night, you can drink on our shuttles, we give out free glow sticks and we provide unlimited free ice cold bottles of water for everyone there and back. We also have phone chargers on board in case anyone wants to get a quick charge in during the trip. It is a really fun trip for everyone involved! \n\nHere are a few pics of our vans from last year: http://imgur.com/gydWlzP http://imgur.com/VxUHKMZ\n\nIf anyone wants to reserve a seat/s for themselves or their group or has any questions whatsoever please post in this thread or message me and I'll get you all set up with us.

Limited amount of spots left! Do you need a ride to and from the strip to the speedway and back (approx 18 miles each way)? We will get you to the Las Vegas Motor Speedway each day and get you back to your hotel in the morning!","selftext":"Come with us, only 2 weeks until EDC LAS VEGAS!\nHere is the rundown on our VIP shuttle service. \nMy 2 friends and I run 3 private brand new 15 person shuttle vans every EDC LV, this will be our 6th year operating!\nWe leave the strip to drop people off at the Speedway at approximately 5PM, 6PM, 7PM, 8PM, and 9PM and the returning trips are at approximately 2AM, 3AM, 4AM, 5AM, 6AM and our last shuttles leaves the speedway around 7AM or so. If you are booked with us then you are guaranteed a ride! Those times are approximate but since we have 3 15 passenger vans we have some leeway with times and getting everyone there and back when they want.\nWe drop off and pick up in the designated pick up/drop off lot at the LV Motor Speedway (Usually lot #4 on Las Vegas Blvd) and get in and out really fast. Our base is at Mandalay Bay so we try to have as many people as we can meet up with us there if they are staying nearby and then we make 2 or 3 other stops to pick up people when it's not convenient for them to get to Mandalay Bay. We also do pickups/dropoffs downtown or off the strip. On the way back we drop everyone off at their individual hotels since everyone is tired and just wants to get back to their hotel ASAP. We charge $25 per person each way, ($150 for roundtrip service all 3 days) if we bring you to the speedway from the strip then you are guaranteed a ride back with us as long as the ride back is paid for when we meet up to take you to EDC. We don't offer just rides back to the strip from EDC, we offer ROUNDTRIP SERVICE ONLY. We started pre booking and reservations about 3 months ago and as of now we are about 90% booked so we only have a limited number of seats/spots left. We take a deposit thru Paypal and then you can pay us the balance the first day we pick you up to go to the speedway. This year will be our 6th year running our EDC Las Vegas shuttles. Most of the people that come with us are repeat riders from previous years, friends and friends of friends and fellow Redditors. Last year we transported a lot of Redditors and a lot of them are coming with us again this year. With us there is no waiting around for hours in lines to get to EDC or hours and hours of waiting in lines to get back to your hotel after EDC and unlike the official shuttles where you must take it from a specific hotel and back to the same hotel we will pick you up at whichever hotel you want and take you back to what ever hotel you want to go to. Did I mention that there is no waiting for hours for us to take you back to your hotel in the morning after EDC is over for the night! We consider ourselves an express shuttle service with VIP service since we prebook everyone and you know your pickup times in advance and don't have to stand around for hours and hours waiting in line to get on a shuttle. If you decide you want to leave earlier then planned just text me or one of my other 2 drivers and you can hop on an earlier shuttle, we're pretty lenient in that regard, our main goal is to make sure everyone gets to and from EDC in a safe and fun manner and that everyone makes it home safe and in a timely manner in the morning. We blast EDM music the whole way there to get everyone in the mood for the night, you can drink on our shuttles and we provide unlimited free ice cold bottles of water for everyone there and back. We also have phone chargers on board in case anyone wants to get a quick charge in during the trip. It is a really fun trip for everyone that rides with us!\nHere are a few pics of our vans from last year: http://imgur.com/gydWlzP http://imgur.com/VxUHKMZ\nIf anyone wants to reserve a seat/s for themselves or their group or has any questions whatsoever please post in this thread or message me and I'll get you all set up with us.

So I wanted to help out my fellow ravers by putting together a post of things to bring, and do! I hope it helps you guys, can't wait to see you there!\n\n**Things you need to bring:**\n\n- Camelbak -  you will be thirsty and need to drink a lot of water, but carrying around a water bottle is annoying and you have to fill it too often. Just make sure it does not have too many pockets, and make sure when you are in line that it is completely empty (it will make it easier for security to check it and less likely they will stop you)\n\n- Waterbottle - thanks to /u/blondie232 for bringing up this tip, bring one or two water bottles with you so while you stand in line you dont get dehydrated (lines can be long to get into EDC and it WILL be hot), just throw it away when you get to security.\n\n- Chapstick - your lips will get dry, it's hot, and your sweating like crazy - 1 for each night (they only allow fresh packs in)\n\n- Gum - again, one pack per night nothing sweet, something minty. (sweet gum is too much for your taste buds, although some people prefer it) plus chewing can help with any jaw issues\n\n- Portable charger - your phone WILL die! I'm talking about both a battery pack and the cable charger.\n\n- Shoe insoles - SO IMPORTANT, you are on your feet for 8 hours dancing, this is a life saver \n\n- Emergen-C - vitamin C helps you stay energized, it also has a lot of good vitamins for you so you don't over hydrate, I drink one right before I enter\n\n- Magnesium pills 500mg- helps stop jaw clenching (I take it in line before getting searched, and another during the event, although they will not usually let you bring it in)\n      - /u/iheartchrisyang mentioned that to some people Magnesium acts as a \"diuretic and makes certain people want to shit themselves\" lol. I haven't experienced this but use at your own risk!\n\n- [Vicks nasal inhaler](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MCSHNO/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_1?pf_rd_p=1944687722&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=B000LNEBOW&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=QGSK7H7T3D0WFSGTCBXY) - it's dry in the desert do the menthol feels really good, you can also perform what is called a \"vicks blast\" (google it) but I have been informed that it can cause damage to the eye as people either blast it too hard or the liquid actually gets into the eye (which can be bad) instead it has been recommend that you use [Rhoto coolness relief] (https://www.amazon.com/Rohto-Cool-Redness-Relief-0-4/dp/B00I9K3C12?ie=UTF8&*Version*=1&*entries*=0)\n\n- Water spray bottle - it feels soooo good to spray yourself and others with water!\n\n- Passport and drivers license - in case you loose your DL at the event (they wont let you in without ID no matter what), also make photocopies of both incase you lose them!\n\n- Eye drops - they help a lot with dry eyes and feel good\n\n- Thanks to /u/fettuccine- who recommended Melatonin to help you sleep (I've never tried it before in this scenario, as I use other methods to go to sleep, but I believe it could work just as well).\n\n- Wear as little as possible! its 90+ degrees at night in Vegas + dancing + crowds\n\n- [Ear plugs](https://www.amazon.com/Etymotic-Research-ETY-Plugs-Protection-Earplugs/dp/B0044DEESS?ie=UTF8&keywords=ear%20plugs&qid=1463592286&ref_=sr_1_9_s_it&s=hpc&sr=1-9) - it will be loud, and it will destroy your ears. I was the only one in my group not to have ringing in my ears because of them, this is what I got last year\n\n- Hand Sanitizer - the bathrooms run out of water after about an hour or so\n\n- Baby Wipes - Bathrooms also run out or have no Toilet Paper after about an hour or so each day, nothing worse than having to take a dump and not having anything to wipe with!\n__________________________________________________________________________\n\n**TIPS!**\n\n- create 1 stationary major meeting spot for all 3 days. always meet there at the end of the night (NEVER CHANGE THE SPOT) pick something specific and easy to identify, example (this specific corner of a big display)\n     - thats to /u/guavabuddy92 who pointed out that this should be done whenever the group disperses for small things too like going to the bathroom or getting water, clearly agree on a local spot and meet there, dont just say meet outside the bathrooms.\n- drive to the event and park VIP, it will save you a minimum of 2 hours.\n- Also for the love of god get there early, you'll deal with less traffic and youll get to enjoy more of the event!\n- timestamp all of your texts (the reason is that texts often get received anywhere from half an hour to two hours after they are sent, and almost always out of order)\n       - example: I text you at 7pm \"im leaving to kinetic field (7:10pm)\", then at 7:40pm i text \"come to the meeting spot (7:45pm)\"\n       - odds are you'll get the come to the meeting spot text first then the kinetic field one. you'll think i left the meeting spot. time stamps help you figure out which one is most recent\n- Along these lines, /u/SpecificInitials had a great tip of memorizing a friends phone number and writing it down somewhere safe in case your phone dies or you lose your phone.\n- I don't condone taking drugs of any kind, but please be careful, don't take too many, if you don't feel well ask a stranger or a paramedic for help! Also please don't take any thing out in the open, that's the easiest way to get kicked out or arrested\n- create an outline of your plan for who to visit, but be flexible! dont stick to it if you want to do something different\n- also please dont try to organize everyone to do one thing when there are too many of you, it will just cause a headache cause people want to do different things. split up, but just set a time to meet back at the meeting spot for the next show you want to see together. I usually give a 15 minute window before I leave the meeting spot if my friends arent there by then. Theres no use in wasting time when theres so much to do!\n- All Insomniac events have booths that sell cut fruits (oranges, watermelons, etc)... BUY SOME. Just trust me, by an orange and ask them to cut it for you, it will be amazing. No one ever believes me because they think it'll be too much to handle but once they try it they are AMAZED! the juicy texture and sweetness is perfect, it doesnt overwhelm you or taste bland and nasty like most other foods. Plus it has a lot of extra sugars and vitamins that your body needs due to depletion of dancing and over-hydration.\n\n\n**UPDATE:** added some recommendations from commentors, also added the links that I promised\n\n**UPDATE 2:** I removed my bit about the band-aids as my mailbox has been spammed about it and I don't want to break the rules here, sorry.\n\n**UPDATE 3:** Guys, I cant discuss anything about drugs as per the rules, I have removed any instances where I talk about illegal drugs from my post. Mods, please let me know if I am doing anything against the rules, I will fix anything you need me to.\n"},"4n85de":{"author":"KHYBER_RSR","id":"4n85de","created_utc":1465429993,"num_comments":7,"score":1,"title":"Called FrontGate...","selftext":"I called FrontGate just to see what they would say.

There are a lot of things you need to do on day 1 that take up time, but set up the rest of the weekend to be perfect. I've seen a lot of these tips mentioned in other threads but I've decided to procrastinate on packing and put them all here.\n\n1. If you want merch, get it Day 1 and I mean as soon as you get to the festival. Any line up shirts/hoodies will sell out. The hotter merch goes by the end of day 1 as well. Yes it sucks holding onto it but you only have to do it once until it's back at your hotel. This year there's merch by the shuttle stops so you can get it on the way back but 100% get it day 1! Not all the booths have the same items if they start selling out.\n\n2. Speaking of holding onto things, I like to grab a couple festival guides, insomniac magazines, and anything else I might want to keep for my edc memorabilia. Get it all out of the way day 1 so you don't have to worry about it the rest of the weekend.\n\n3. Meeting spots: Pick a spot on the map, walk over to it, and say this is our meeting spot. If you've never been, the map is deceivingly small. Meeting at an art installation isn't specific enough when there are easily a few hundred people surrounding it. Be specific and be visual!\n\n4. Get your bearings. Going early helps with this so you don't get right into the music. Take some time to walk around and find the cool spots, water stations and explore inside every little area. There's lots of freebies at edc you just have to find them. Nothing like finding that cool hidden area on day 3 and wishing you had it on days 1 and 2.\n\n5. Time: Again if you've never been, you'll see how long it takes to traverse the speedway. A 5 min walk is easily 20 when you have a group of 10 in tow and need to stop by the water station and restrooms.\n\nI'm sure there are plenty more day 1 tips but that's my slight contribution before the fest!\nFeel free to add or expand upon anything I may have missed.

I have been to EDC for many years and this experience alone makes me reconsider coming back next year.\n\nWe had been coming fairly late to the speedway the first two days (taking JusCollege shuttles), but the security lines getting in were always pretty quick and the people searching bags/bodies very respectful and friendly (quick and reasonably thorough).\n\nThe third day, we arrive relatively early (at speedway a little before 10pm), we walk from the JusCollege drop-off lot (already a 20+ min walk to gates). We make it to our regular entrance (which appears to still have a line, security guards, etc.), BUT for some reason they have closed it off and are redirecting 100s (possibly thousands) of people arriving from the private shuttles to a different entrance. So we follow the dirt road for another 20+ minutes to meet a massive (expected) crowd and line. So we get in line. Go through the wristband scanner, ID check, and get in line for the security check. We wait for about an hour in those lines, on the hottest night with no access to water or liquids. At this point, I am fairly annoyed, but really not a big deal. I don't mind waiting and had kept hydrated on the bus in case of situations like this. Though I am slightly worried about my partner who was not feeling well and had been complaining about the heat since we left the hotel.\n\nAnyway, we make it to the front of the line and notice many more cops than are typically at the gate and a much more thorough check from the security than we had the last two days. So I start wondering if why we had been redirected to this gate is so the cops could maintain more control of the entrance. I notice past the security on the side about 7 or 8 in handcuffs already or being arrested by police. But what really sent me over the edge was the two security guards in the lane next to me. This lane had been moving faster than the few lanes next to it because there were two people checking. Consequently some people had been cutting into that line to get in quicker. Well both of these two security guards were excessively groping male and female attendees by the genitals/private areas, insulting attendees, and literally dragging people (some who I don't even think they had specifically found anything illegal/prohibited on yet) by the waistband and violently throwing them at the cops to be searched/arrested.\n\nSome noteable things I heard from these two security guards say to cops and attendees:\n- Security to attendee who had just had his genitals and ass groped for 60+ seconds: \"What is in there?\" Attendee: \"My dick...\" Security: \"You have a pretty small dick.\" *grabs attendee by waistband and holds him above the ground crushing his genitals for at least a minute and then grabs and throws him at a cop who has seen and walked over to pick up the attendee for further search/arrest*\n- Conversation between other security guard in that line and cop (the cop had just searched a different attendee who had been taken over by security - and security had not even found anything on the attendee before taking him to the cop - maybe he was intoxicated so they made assumptions?). Security: \"Where did you find it on him? His underwear, his shoes, his asshole?\" Cop: \"I didn't yet. This is why we need to be given latex gloves.\"\n\nNo joke the most disgusting things I HAVE EVER SEEN at a music festival or rave (watching countless people being assumed guilty and taken to cops and some subsequently arrested for discretely carrying a small amount of substances for personal use) after my years and years attending them all across the country and world. And it really made me wonder what the security guards (some were more enthusiastic about helping the cops than others) incentives were to be blatantly helping the cops meet there arrest quota on the last night. Were the cops blackmailing them? Were they getting a reward for each successful bust? I can't imagine all these turned security guards were treating attendees like criminals, insulting, and humiliating them, and risking their jobs just to do \"the right thing.\" And I'm not saying that security shouldn't be allowed to perform a reasonably thorough search for prohibited items, but their top priority should be the safety of the attendees, not to help the cops make arrests."},"4p7czc":{"author":"suicidebaneling","id":"4p7czc","created_utc":1466548037,"num_comments":14,"score":8,"title":"To my hardstyle family.","selftext":"I want to thank everyone that was kind to me during EDC, but more than anything I want to express my love for everyone at Wasteland.

What's done is done and the chances of us getting our stuff back is pretty slim at this point. My intent and purpose in writing this is to educate and inform others. This whole ordeal sucks and I don't wish for something like this to ever happen to anyone else.\n\nAnyway...this year was my fourth and final EDC Las Vegas. I went with 3 other friends. We stayed at Planet Hollywood, checked in around 1PM on Thursday 6/16 and checked out 11AM Monday 6/20. Unfortunately, our room was robbed sometime during Saturday evening/Sunday morning, while we were at EDC day 2. \n\nAt first none of us even realized it. I woke up on day 3 searching for my wallet, but wasn't able to find it. Our room was very messy because let's be real, it's EDC/Vegas and no one's room is ever clean during this weekend lol. I thought it had just been misplaced at first or under a pile of clothes somewhere. I didn't bring my wallet with me outside the hotel room at any point during the weekend (I use a phone case that holds my ID/credit card so I left my wallet in the room at all times). I know for a fact I had my wallet before we left for day 2 because I clearly remember taking out cash to bring with me to the festival.\n\nAn hour or so later my friend was packing up his stuff because they were planning to leave to the airport as soon as they got back from the festival and realized that his spare phone was missing. That's when we put two and two together and realized that we were robbed, and that that was the reason why I couldn't find my wallet even though we seemingly looked everywhere. I quickly ran over to my backpack to find that my Macbook, GoPro, and external hard drive were also gone, as well as my watch that was on the desk nearby. Our other friend lost her wallet and credit cards. All in all we lost around $3000 worth of stuff. \n\nWe immediately called security, who came after about 20 minutes. They asked us to go into detail about what we lost, what time we were gone from, etc., basically all the stuff I explained above. They gave us some forms to fill out and asked for our contact information. They also advised us to call and file a report with Metro PD and gave us specific instructions on what to tell them, and also gave us the reference number of the hotel's security report so that Metro PD can coordinate with the hotel and vice versa. We were told that they would undergo an investigation to check the security footage and the locks and then contact us when they find anything. I was also told that because of the value of the items lost, this would be investigated as grand theft, which is a felony. \n\nWe (my group + security) immediately began to go over exactly how this could have happened and who could have done it. We were issued 4 hotel keys when we checked in, one for each of us. None of us ever lost or misplaced of our keys. We also never had any guests/random people over, it was only us, so it wasn't like we threw a fat rager and someone swiped us while we were all passed out drunk or anything either. \n\nThe security supervisor told us that most of the time when stuff like this happens, its human error. He brought up the possibility that maybe we left the door open or didn't close it all the way, or that perhaps the deadbolt was engaged and we didn't realize it when we were closing the door in a rush to get out and didn't turn around to check.\n\nThis is all possible. I'm not going to rule it out. That said, I HIGHLY doubt that we were that careless. Hotel doors are very heavy and rather loud when they close, and it's very obvious to see, hear, and feel whether or not a door is fully closed or not. We also engaged the deadbolt, went outside the room, and then closed the door in an attempt to see what it would look/sound like if we had done this while in a hurry to get out. From the outside, it looked plain as day that the door is not fully closed, and the sound that the door made was clearly different as well (sound of a deadbolt hitting a small part of the frame vs. the sound of an entire door slamming shut). \n\nIn addition to that, the doors at PH swing with a lot of force and momentum because of how heavy they are. Even if we had swung the door open in a hurry to get out and didn't turn around to check that it closed, the force that it would've swung back with would almost certainly caused it to close anyway. It is nearly impossible to \"accidentally\" leave the door open/not closed all the way unless you are deliberately trying to do so. With this in mind, I am almost positive that we were not that careless to leave the door open. \n\nWe though of the possibility that maybe a member of the hotel staff came in and took our things. After all, they they have access to the all the rooms. Our \"Do Not Disturb\" sign was on all weekend, but if the hotel staff knows that we're here for EDC (it's kinda obvious to tell who is and who isn't) then they also know that we're going to be gone for 8+ hours each night and at what times. The security supervisor said it was possible, but he assured us that all hotel staff goes through extensive background checks dating back to 10 years prior, and that any hotel employee who is caught stealing is banned by the state of Nevada from ever working in a hotel again. While I'm glad to hear that the background checks are so stringent, that still doesn't erase the possibility that it was a hotel staff member. What if the employee had a clean record prior and just said \"F it, I'm done with this job\" and decided to go rob rooms? And surely there are plenty of staff from plenty of hotels that have stolen before and just never got caught; having a clean record does not make you a clean person. \n\nAnd the third possibility we thought of: we may have just been hit by professional thieves. There are people who steal for a living and have the resources and methods to break into just about anything, including Vegas hotel doors. Key cards can be faked or compromised if you have the right tools to do so.\n\nAnyway, the purpose of this post is to inform and educate, although I don't think I'm ever going to stay at PH again. It's been two days and they haven't so much as contacted us, nor did they offer to discount or compensate us in any way. Not so much as something small like a buffet voucher or waiving the resort fee, absolutely nothing. At this point I really don't think any of us is going to get our stuff back, but we did learn a lot from this and I urge you all to follow these tips next time you go on vacation anywhere:\n\n1. MAKE SURE YOUR DOOR IS LOCKED. I know that everyone gets super excited to leave the room and head to the Speedway, especially if you're running late, which always happens in Vegas (you get too turnt and sleep in, people take longer than expected to get ready, the line for Bacchanal was 2 hours long, etc., whatever the reason may be). Sometimes we might just swing the door behind us and run out. Take the time to close the door fully and try to open it once you do just to make sure that it's completely closed. \n\n2. USE YOUR ROOM SAFE. I cannot stress this enough. Throughout all my years of EDC, I have never used the room safe. Stupid me. I always thought, \"What's the worst that could happen? This is a big hotel on the strip, it's safe, right? Who could possibly break in and how?\" Regardless of who or how, the room safe is there for a reason. Use it.\n\n3. PUT THE \"DO NOT DISTURB\" SIGN ON. I've heard lots of stories about stuff being stolen while housekeeping is cleaning peoples' rooms. If you need new towels or toilet paper or whatever, just call and have them bring it up. Make sure to open the door yourself to pick the items up instead of letting them come in. This won't guarantee 100% that hotel staff won't take your stuff, but at least by using the sign you are giving them an explicit \"NO\" and they are breaking the law and your right to privacy by entering, even if you are not there. \n\n4. MIND YOUR SURROUNDINGS. This goes for life in general and also being at festivals. If you see some shady people/activity going on, be careful and stay vigilant.\n\n5. DON'T LOITER. Look, this one happens everywhere I go in Vegas. I'm guilty of this myself. Your group is in the room pregaming/pounding shots, half the group slowly makes their way into the hallway, a few people are still inside not quite ready yet, the door is open, everyone is loud and excited and just hanging out in the hall. Anyone who happens to pass by (or people in nearby rooms looking out their peephole) now knows that are you in town for EDC and that you're about to leave and be gone for 8+ hours. Your room is now a prime target for thieves, burglars, shady people, etc. Try to keep your door closed at all times and when you do leave, make it as quick as possible. \n\n6. BE CAREFUL WHO YOU LET IN YOUR ROOM. I trust everyone in my hotel room with my life. That said, I know it's Vegas and a lot of times people throw parties and have other people over. Those people might ask to bring friends who then bring friends of friends who then ask other friends to come over, and so on and so forth, and then you might end up with a dozen people in your room, half of whom you don't know or are just meeting for the first time. I have had friends who threw parties and woke up with stuff missing, taken by people who were in the room at the time of the party. If you don't know someone, it's probably not a good idea to let them in, especially if everyone is drinking and not in the right state of mind. \n\nAnyway, I'm rather exhausted right now and have said just about all I can. I know this was a super long post and was rambly at points BUT, I truly hope that this serves as a PSA and helps people out in the future. This was a terrible thing to go through and I truly hope that this never happens to anyone else. And besides from this, I can honestly say that this was one of the best trips and the best EDC I've ever been to, and I refuse to let something like this bring me down. We may have lost a few thousand dollars worth of material goods, but we made memories that made a lifetime.\n\nI hope you all had a blast at EDC, and until next time!"},"4pbkd8":{"author":"OXNEZ5","id":"4pbkd8","created_utc":1466613095,"num_comments":0,"score":3,"title":"Yo, lets get this line Turnt!","selftext":"Met the friendliest people (and of course they are Canadians) at EDC, while waiting in line we were pumping up the line, chanting Seattle, Canada and Yo, lets get this line turnt, givng light shows and massages.

It was in LA, and I carpooled with a few random ravers that I'd met from the internet, on a rave forum. The driver was 30 and spunky, the other passengers were early 20s. Even though I didn't say it at the time, I thought that was pretty old to be going to a \"kiddie rave\" like EDC. Still, she was a sober driver the whole way (#1 quality for a driver) and we shared lots of stories and laughs along the way.\n\nFast forward 6 years!\n\nI was planning on driving to Vegas in my own car but a couple months before, my girlfriend says she wants it to go camping with a friend coming in from out-of-town. OK, no problem. I get on reddit and ask if anyone wants to carpool. Finally lock down 3 other people about a week before we leave. Felt kinda \"old school\" - meeting randoms on the internet to hop in a car and drive hours to some rave in another state.\n\nI have a mission too - I'm running [an electronic music calendar](http://19hz.info) and I want to hand out cards to people who might be interested. So I come with ~500 business cards that I think will become a pretty easy talking point as I meet people.\n\nAfter leaving on Wednesday around 4pm from the Bay Area, we finally get into Vegas around 2:40am. I drop off one of the riders, while the three of us hang out in the hotel room, since the other two guys don't have check in until ~9 hours later. These peeps decide to stay up REALLY late and party, but I'm pooped from driving the whole way and pass out around 5:30\n\nThursday begins with the sun waking me up around 11. Other guys are sleeping so I decide to do a little bit of work and get in a couple games of Starcraft/League. Around 1:30pm I'm off to will call (I haven't gotten my box in yet, was one of those lucky guys that's still stuck at \"Shipment informatino received\").\n\nTalked to guy from Australia in that will call line for ~90 minutes before finally getting to the front. Learned about [bush doofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doof) and Rainbow Serpent, methheads in Australia, balancing work and life, and a lot of other things I've forgotten about by now. This started a theme for the weekend - friendly conversations for long periods of time with strangers, while waiting/passing the time.\n\nChill out for most of the day - head up to the reddit meetup which is pretty close-by anyways. I'm there for a while it seems, just gabbing with people about the calendar and rave life and where are you from and have you been out here before and whatnot. Much love to everyone who comes across the country for this - Carolinas, Philadelphia, Ohio, Omaha. I hear lots of chatter about pool parties but I get sleepy just thinking about them. I fall asleep with the rooms around me blasting dubstep/trap and big room house through the walls\n\n10 minutes away walking. Or at least I think it's 10 minutes - turns out that there's some construction or elevator failure on the south side of Tropicana and Las Vegas Blvd. which means in order to get from Excalibur to Tropicana you have to walk north over the skybridge (or whatever it's called) to NY NY, then east to MGM Grand, then south back to Tropicana, which adds like an extra 5-7 minutes for me. Someone else commented that it seems like the escalators are always broken when in Vegas. What's up with that, maybe we just have bad timing.\n\nI get to the new hotel a little bit early (that whole thing where you check out of one place at noon and get to your other place at 1 and they're like - sorry check-in starts at 3) but the lounge is nearly empty so I'm just chilling in the AC. Tried to strike up conversation with a couple who were talking in German - turns out they're from Berlin. I'm thinking to myself, \"Berlin? Maybe they have some cool techno stories for me\" and I ask them \"Are you here for EDC? The music festival?\"\n\nThey give me a blank look and ask \"No, what is that?\" and I'm like \"It's like techno!\" and they're like \"Nooooo that's not really our kind of scene\" and I'm like \"oh\" and basically go back to playing on my phone. \n\nThe room itself was not bad for being cheap (~$70/night) plus I just love having my own place. I setup shop and get ready. I dress relatively plainly, just a colorful t-shirt, khakis, and sneakers. No kandi (although I support the kandi culture quite a bit), no backpack/bags, essentially gear-less. Two phones, a wallet, chapstick, and an altoid tin in my pockets. Party favors ready and I make sure my phones are charged. Then I turn one of them off and the other on airplane mode.\n\nI head over to Excalibur, get a sandwich from the food court and go up to hang out with some of the peeps I had exchanged a wristband with on the way there; turns out they live in Houston (where I'd spent ~4 years), small-world type stuff. Although I am years older than them and I'm just smirking at the group of 8 gathering for youthful toasts, big room house playing out of tiny iphone speakers in this cramped hotel room. People are definitely getting hyped in here. But I can't stay for long, I want to get to the shuttles.\n\nGet down to the shuttle line around 5:30 and people are pumped. Personally, I end up napping on the shuttle, which is probably good, since I needed it. I wake up, chat with the guy next to me who explains the difference between death metal, stoner metal, and speed metal. I'd still probably google that stuff though\n\nGet off the shuttle around 8pm (barely a security check, the quickest pat down I've ever had) and hopped down that hill into the speedway, feeling a bit of excitement. It's Day 1.\n\nThe kalliope art car is the first thing I run into and I always get the fattest shit-eating grin at the first moment when I can recognize music instead of hearing thumping bass and unintelligible sounds otherwise. I bounce around the entire perimeter and in and out of every stage/nook/cranny I can find for a few hours. Figured out where the smoothie stands were, (frozen) lemonades, free water. Exits, stage layout, booths. There's already too much to gather for one night AND have time to dance.\n\nI have a sense of what kind of sounds are happening where, and as I dancer I know my ears are going to lead me towards Neon Garden the most, but I'm going where the wind blows most of the time, while trying to say \"Hi\" people with Cali gear to promote the calendar, looking out for peeps who might not have happy expressions (maybe someone by him/herself with a sad face), trying to remember to not get TOO caught up in dancing and take the time to smile.\n\nI remember vividly the first time I went into the Oasis tent, saw the harm reduction info, dancesafe card, project zendo... mind was blown. That was a great moment, and the only time I pulled out my phone to post something online - to know that they'd finally made their way back into EDC, wow.\n\nI made at least 5 full trips around the whole place then I decided to start grooving. The wideAwake art car was jamming some jungle so I got down to that for a while - definitely not the easiest way to start off since the music is so fast - and went between those guys, Wasteland, and Neon Garden. I got into my routine. Dance for 30-50 min, get hot, walk over to get an icey drink, wander the Speedway for 30-50 min, start dancing again. Dusky caught my ear with some classic house jams. Wiggled to some bassline at the 7-Up stage. I usually do a better job at making a note about when I'm at what stage at least, but this day 1 slipped my mind. A lot of wandering, a lot of talking to people, marching around to the music that was nearby\n\nAt one point I wandered up to the 2nd floor of Carnival Square, and then walked right by a security guard on the 3rd floor, then went all the way up to the top where it turns out the media and press people hung out. Open bar, nice catered food, AC'd bathrooms, separate wi-fi connection. Lots of people there to do work though, for sure.\n\nIt was oddly quiet up there, you could hear the rumbling of 5 or 6 stages throughout the night, and the view from the balcony was (from left-to-right) kinetic, wasteland, basspod, circuit, the landscape of lights and sounds. When the fireworks went off the view was spectacular. Honestly reminded me of the view from deep playa at night at Burning Man, when you turn around and see all the sound systems lined up from end-to-end. EDC wasn't quite as visually stimulating in the sense that there wasn't as much \"moving activity\" (e.g. art cars), but still an amazing picture. I started talking to some of those guys/gals up there, writers for different papers and websites. A very unique experience for sure. Made some lovely connections up there, talking about music, rave/EDM culture, life in California. Security eventually came around to check for the specific press wristbands but my new friends supported me - turns out media/press people can have guests up there. Purely luck that I managed to get up there, that's all I can think about looking back.\n\nI chilled up for there a while but the dancing spark started hitting me again. I went down and I think Hot Since 82 was just starting up. I was bouncing around for a while, then wandered off towards Wasteland to catch some hardcore (Darren Styles) before exiting out to the shuttle around 4:30. There's nothing quite like happy hardcore on a giant sound system, honestly. Turns out the Excalibur line had like 20 people in it - super short wait - my fears of an incredibly long shuttle line swept away by reality. A nap and 15 min walk later and I'm passed out in my hotel.\n\nSirloin steak for breakfast after getting up, then a Dogfish Head and a nap to follow. Try to sort through some of the contacts from the night before but I'm feeling especially lazy. A shower helps, but then it's time to go. Back to the shuttle line, more smiling youth all around me. I get there so early this time we actually sit in the line b/c the shuttle's not even there yet.\n\nDay 2 I was there so early it seemed like they weren't even letting people in. I got searched a bit more hard and told to throw my altoid tin away. So I put it into the trash can behind the guard. Then walked by the guard, waited a few seconds while he started searching the guy after me, then picked up that tin and put it back in my pocket. That one's still working for me after all these years.\n\nI spent a lot of the first few hours hanging around the \"grass village\" - all the little pop-up buildings and chill spaces on the grass area. Grooved to this [wonky guy](https://www.facebook.com/robbiefitz101/) for a little bit. I love the contrast between the chill areas/structures in the grass, relatively dimly lit, up against the futuristic LED carnival world. During this time I think I tried to meetup with a couple people and not surprisingly phone coverage failed miserably. So I decided to dance\n\nI was near Cosmic Meadow but the thumping from Neon Garden took me that way. Lane 8 was finishing, and Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs (TEED)/Jonas Rathsman came on. I parked myself to the left of the stage, where there was a lot of room to dance, still inside the \"tent\" though. I don't really care at looking at visuals while dancing, so I gigged there for a while - music was super weird techno and I loved it. Pretty much my favorite set of the weekend. I ended up at Wasteland for Caspa/Rusko after, then back to Neon Garden during Nicole Moudaber's set.\n\nTook a breather to circle the festival again. I did walk over to Kinetic although I must have been like 500 ft away. I started talking to an older looking guy, who told me he was here b/c his son had turned 18 and had really wanted to go, so he decided to check it out with him. That was pretty awesome. Another nugget - I saw a group of maybe late 30s/early 40s near upsidedown House during this time. I started chatting with them and it turns out they used to help Pasquale throw warehouse raves in the mid-late 90s. Apparently he had found a bunch of them on facebook and invited them to come for the 20th anniversary. They all had VIP passes with a picture from their old raves days on one side, plus a recent picture on the other. That was some cool shit.\n\nI ended up at cosmic Meadow during Shiba San finishing up and stayed for most of Tycho's set. When he cranked out [this monster tune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eCjgY_NqXA) I went bonkers. Someone out there has a video of me spinning with a couple random ladies who came by to dance, hope y'all enjoyed it x_x\n\nAs his set progressed and the crowd thinned, I kinda felt bad looking around at all the trash on the grass, so I started kicking the bottles and cans into little piles while dancing along to the music, maybe did this for half an hour. I probably could have done it for more, but I left around 5:10am so I could beat out the shuttle lines. Instead of napping I had a nice conversation with a young raver from San Luis Obispo the whole way down.\n\nDay 3 I decided to have an omelette instead of steak for my morning meal? My stomach wasn't a huge fan, but it all pushed through my system before I got to the shuttle line : )\n\nEnded up sitting next to someone I had met the previous day in line, that was fun. Early birds flock together I guess. Security line was short, and I had no issues at all.\n\nMusically I had a feeling Sunday was gonna be my favorite. It was, no doubt. I danced my way to Mercer at Kinetic - waltzed right up to the front and grooved for ~10 minutes while the sun was still up - then over to drum and bass/jungle at Basspod (Kasra/Mefjus), then got a drink and ended up at upsideDown House to hear Ron D Core channel the fuck out of Spiral Tribe with hardcore techno - I was stomping around and telling anyone I talked to \"you are not gonna hear anything like this at EDC any time soon again!\" - my inner techno viking reveling. After that set I was pooped and took a while to catch my breath. Next set I remember was Richie Hawtin, who I'd never actually heard do a live set before. Pretty sure I ended up around the perimeter of Neon Garden dancing, smiling, freaking out the passerbys. There's something I enjoy about having a huge grin and airdrumming to very raw, rhythmic techno sounds, marching to the beat of the 808s and 909s.\n\nI hung out up at the media/press center again (after being let in by a friend) and caught a couple hours of view/chill before heading back downstairs, checking out Mark Farina. One of his early tunes had a 3/4 bar in it; I love hearing that kinda stuff in dance music. The jazz grooves and funky bass and soulful samples, what a way to bring the sun up. ~5:15 and I'm out. Had another nice conversation the entire way down with a Socal raver.\n\n3 hours of sleep later, have myself another diner breakfast, then go off to pick up my friends for the drive back. A few hours from home, it dawns on me that I'm the 30 year old driving the 24 year olds now.\n\nI feel like I gave a lot of advice throughout the weekend, more than I could have ever seen myself doing back in 2009/2010. I think for the most part, people seemed receptive and interested to hear my \"old man\" rave stories. But... I guess I need to download snapchat, because I definitely was looking around a lil funny when everyone was like \"oh snap me\"\n\nThoughts on the setup:\n\n* That walkway with the old footage/music from past EDCs was cool but. For some reason I never saw anything before 2008? I did like how they played the big songs from those respective years though. It was usually incredibly bright in there, that's for sure. Always big smiles going through that tunnel.\n* Maybe I just got lucky and the conversation was really good this year, but I never felt like the lines for the shuttles and even to get into the speedway were very long. I actually spent more time at will call than anywhere else (turns out I should have just gone at like 4am). Then again I always got there early and left a little bit before close.\n* basspod highs sounded really off on day 3. Maybe post-fire problems? I was joking that of course it's the drum and bass stage that gets shafted on sound. Didn't really go back there that day so maybe they fixed it later.\n* For some reason the trash at cosmic meadow bugs me the most. Seeing trash on grass is sadface. The recycling booth was a lot further away this year too. I got a tote bag and a keychain but if I had more enthusiasm I'm sure I could have picked up way more swag. Most of the time I was just pushing trash into piles instead of bagging them up and taking them all the way to the recycling station\n* smirnoff House looked cool but way too crowded every time I walked by\n* I can't say this enough but Oasis was fucking awesome. High five to everyone that worked the booth and a pleasure to meet Paul in person.\n* Not a fan of carnival rides I always wonder what the most popular ones are.\n* VR Live, whoa. Didn't expect that\n* I don't vape, but I loved the AC in that building\n* When the stink from the bathrooms floats into Neon Garden.\n* Wasteland needs more happy hardcore.\n* Basspod needs more jungle/drum and bass.\n* Trance (Dreamstate) should have its own stage. And one of the days should be purely psy/goa\n* 7-UP stage I wish I had more time for you. You were playing some great music on day 3\n* Carnival square smoothie line was giant. The one between basspod and wasteland had like 2 people though.\n* DAE 2nd floor carnival square?!? Seemed like most people didn't even know you could go up there. Let alone the whole media center thing on the 3rd/4th floors.\n* Never went up the bleachers this year. I noticed they had carved out a little VIP section there though, haha\n\nPeople:\n\n* So many stories to share with people. I really good being able to talk about my experiences in the underground rave world in the Bay Area, connect that with the history of EDC and just rave tradition in general that is decades old now (DJs into their 50s!). I met an 18 year old who told me his biology teacher had gone to the first EDC and was stoked for him.\n* Got a chance to meet the dudes driving the Pac Man! They're based in Seattle ~_~\n* I was walking through the VR hallway and totally locked gazes with a lady sitting on a bean bag. Totally doing the rolling thing where you start staring at someone without even knowing. She trailed me for like 15 seconds while I kept looking away occasionally and then looking back and smiling\n* I was telling so many people - this music culture doesn't end when you leave here. You won't find the crowd size or the crazy production, but a lot of good people keep throwing events with positive vibes all over the country - we're out here!\n* Dancing like a fool is fun. Everyone who comes up to me and smiles, or does a little fist bump, or yells out \"get it get it\" - it makes me smile, I hope I make you smile. Stay positive everyone.\n* Early 20s the average age. Probably undergrads/kids in school. A few older heads in their 20s though, more than last year I think. So many beautiful people.\n* Cannabis shop guy who came up to me. I am glad I inspire you. Inspire others - smile, make contact, say \"hi\"\n* Earlier that night while I was spinning around during Tycho's set, something told me something like - you are definitely are on the lowest end of amount of fucks being given right now. My response was \"this is a rave right? shouldn't we all be dancing like this\"\n* Only found a few people who were in any negative position as I wandered between sets. All of them were just waiting for their friends in some fashion.\n* People in wheelchairs/crutches, y'all are amazing\n\nDecent weather this year, so many contacts and friendly faces to work on staying in touch with, music lovely as ever, no lingering injuries! Heh, hella PLUR right now. I can't really see myself not coming back now that I live back in the Bay Area. Already booked a hotel for $50/night heheh hurray for free cancellation\n\nCheers everyone"},"4prp6k":{"author":"ItHurtsWhenIPeeNow","id":"4prp6k","created_utc":1466843480,"num_comments":6,"score":8,"title":"My juscollege shuttle experience","selftext":"Day 1: I was on a shuttle at 6:30 and I did not arrive to EDC until well past 10.

I don't know if anyone out here on reddit will give a shit, and I am expecting a few salty replies. But hopefully some of you in the rave community will know where I'm coming from. I saw a lot of good people go down this weekend at Nocturnal, and it was sad. Unlike anything I've seen before. Anyway, here it goes:\n\nTo whoever at Insomniac might read this letter,\n\nI've been attending Insomniac events for years, and I've never had any experience that has made me doubt that Insomniac truly values and respects its headliners‚Äîuntil I attended Nocturnal Wonderland for one day on Sunday, September 4th. In the Insomniac events I've attended, I've always felt that Insomniac has created a safe space, not only in regard to headliner's physical safety, but their sense of psychological safety as well‚Äîand with a general sense of care for the future of headliners following the festival's conclusion.\n\nIt's because I still want to believe that Insomniac holds these values true that I feel it is necessary to express the sour taste that this years security at Nocturnal Wonderland left in my mouth.\n\nIn all my years of attending electronic music events, I have never experienced such an invasive and truly uncomfortable search while entering the festival. For the first time ever at any event, the security guard asked for permission to \"tug\" on the middle front of my bra (which I was wearing beneath a full corset top). Because the underwire of my bra was concealed by the corset top, this woman literally reached inside my top to \"tug\" on my bra. I'm putting \"tug\" in quotations, because that is not what the security guard did at all. She reached down my top, fiercely yanked my bra, and then proceeded to both of her hands under the cups of my bra to furiously yank on the underwire there, definitely touching my body in the process. Did I pass through security? Of course I did, because I didn't have any contraband. Am I traumatized by some random woman groping me on my way into the event? No. But as I walked away and made my way into the event, it was with an extreme sense of discomfort, the unshakeable sense that the security guard had toed the line of infringing upon my physical rights, and the thought, \"What the hell was that about?\" echoing around in my mind.\n\nObviously this targeting of woman's bras and tops was standard with security at this festival. I've only attended a small fraction of the events Insomniac has to offer, but this absolutely the only security search that I would describe as truly invasive. And I'm not just talking about the women's experience either. I spoke to one guy who was asked to unbutton his pants by a sheriff deputy immediately after he passed the security check, just so the deputy could look down his pants. Another male friend talked about how the guard ran his hands along the inside waistband of his pants, instead of just firmly pressing along the outside like they have at past Insomniac events. And another female friend was asked to remove her insert bra padding, while another friend had a security guard stick her finger inside her bra the check the open space where a bra insert would go.\n\nIt seems to me that there was extreme political motivation behind this intense searching. It is no secret that the San Bernardino County supervisor has been pushing for a ban of raves at San Manuel Amphitheater. With a total of 428 arrests for the weekend, over twice as much as EDC 2016 for a festival half the size, it seems to me that security and the Sheriff's department was out for blood this year so they have strong documentation the next time the opportunity arises for them to attempt to ban Insomniac from holding events at San Manuel. On my way into the event I saw deputies joking around as they were arresting a crying girl, and overheard them laughing about how they were ‚Äúon track to beat‚Äù their numbers from the previous night‚Äîwhich, as I‚Äôm sure you know, they certainly did.\n\nThis was not about compassion. This was not about keeping headliners safe. This was a game fueled by politics, and the attitude from the sheriff‚Äôs department was one of cruel elation and spite. Another example of this is the stories I heard of people that tried to turn around to go back to the amnesty bins‚Äîwhich, where I entered, were nearly hidden by the cluster of people and lack of order, since the lines were building up so far back since everyone was getting essentially as close as you could get to a strip search with your clothes still on‚Äîand the sheriff‚Äôs department people stopped them from going back to the bins and brought them into custody. If it was about safety, why not let those people return a few feet back to the bins? Because it was obvious they had missed them, and only people with contraband would be attempting to reach the bins. Those people going back to dispose of their mistakes were just another number to the sheriff‚Äôs department. Not only that, every person was basically treated as guilty before proved ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù by an uncomfortable security check, and on top of that, it‚Äôs no secret that hundreds of people still passed through those gates with contraband.\n\nI don‚Äôt know how much Insomniac had to do with hiring of security, the sheriff‚Äôs department, or anything else. Which is why I‚Äôm writing, because what was going on at Nocturnal Wonderland wasn‚Äôt consistent with events I‚Äôve attended in the past. I know Insomniac wants to make money and probably has a strong interest in working with the sheriff‚Äôs department to keep San Manuel as a venue. But after all the things I saw and heard this weekend‚Äîalong with the invasive search I received when I was completely innocent‚Äîit would take a lot to get me to attend again, and I‚Äôm certain I‚Äôm not the only one. And with 428 arrests, the victories in this war against Insomniac and raves in San Bernardino county are only going to grow larger.\n\nWhat happened to a lot of young people this weekend was a shame, considering at EDC the number of misdemeanors was low because young people that likely made the biggest mistake of their life merely had their contraband confiscated and their festival ticket voided. Many people‚Äîparticularly when they‚Äôre young and foolish‚Äîhave made a potentially life-altering mistake, and Insomniac has always seemed consistent with giving second chances and keeping people safe both before and after the event. Why else would Ground Control approach people who are clearly on controlled substances only to make sure that they are safe and hydrated? Why not call the police on them? At this point, I would actually be pleased if the Sheriff‚Äôs department won their little war‚Äîbecause then maybe it could be taken to a venue where law enforcement isn‚Äôt on a total witch hunt for the sole purpose of using young people as a number for political leverage against Insomniac.\n\nI doubt anyone that reads this is going to care. I highly doubt anything will change. But I‚Äôm adding my voice to the collective on the slim hope that someone out there still gives a damn.\n \n‚Äîoneravergirl\n\nTL;DR: San Bernardino County has wanted raves banned from San Manuel Amphitheater for some time. They conducted invasive searches last weekend and made a game out of how many people they could arrest, and security and the Sheriff's department was out for blood this year so they have strong documentation the next time the opportunity arises for them to attempt to ban Insomniac from holding events at San Manuel. The entire vibe was \"guilty until proven innocent\", and to be proved innocent was submitting to an search that was as invasive as they could get without asking you to remove your clothing. Amnesty bins were not visible through the cluster fuck of a line, since the line was so long because everyone was getting intensely searched, and people that attempted to go back to amnesty bins were taken into custody. In my opinion, a total witch hunt."},"533ute":{"author":"MarcusMan6","id":"533ute","created_utc":1474056650,"num_comments":45,"score":8,"title":"People who arrive at the venue later than 10pm, why?","selftext":"So, one thing I noticed at my first EDC was that around 10pm (and even later most nights) there were still people pouring into the venue like the gates had just opened. I understand there were an average of 133,000 people there each night, and with 5 or 6 entrances and even fewer roads it takes times and traffic backs up quickly, however the idea that people would pay so much, and miss out on some of the best sets was mind boggling to me.\n\nPersonally, I arrived at the speedway ~5:45-6:15 each day and was standing in line when they opened the gates. (To be fair, I left each day around 3:30-4:30 just to avoid traffic except the last day). I felt like some of the best sets of the weekend were started in the early hours. My personal favorites: Don Diablo, Makj, Michael Calfan, Mercer, Tommy Trash, KDrew, The Magician, etc. [Here's a link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nnhHPmlqBd8w2qismzg4T4fsaSvzBr_bQN-NoydS5sk/edit#gid=0) to the google spreadsheet with daily lineups if you wish to see who you did or didn't miss leaving early or coming late. (Or just want to get another case of PFD).\n\nHeck, I didn't even get to see all the people I listed above. I had conflicts during the opening hour some days, haha. \n\nI guess my question is this. What caused you to arrive past 10pm? Bad planning? Overruled by the rest of your crew? Pool parties? Stay till sunrise the night before? Veteran who is more concerned with the EDC experience as a whole, and not necessarily the sets? (This was my first, I wanted to see a lottttttt of people).

There's seemingly a post (or three) every week either wondering when the lineup is coming - probably May, don't hold your breath - or who might be on it whenever it's eventually released.\n\nAs we looked through past lineups, we started wondering who showed up most often.  Many of the names won't be much of a shock but I was surprised to see certain people, and that the list wasn't actually a bit longer.  I started by looking to see who had been to every EDC since the 2011 move to Vegas and then worked backwards from that group to see who had the longest current streak of EDC appearances.  If there's someone else you're wondering about that doesn't show up here, there was a gap year somewhere.\n\nThe artists who have appeared at every EDC Las Vegas:\n\n* Above and Beyond\n* Afrojack\n* Andy C\n* Avicii\n* Benny Benassi\n* Borgore\n* Crizzly\n* Dada Life\n* Dash Berlin\n* Datsik\n* Fury (w/MC Dino in 3/4 years)\n* Green Velvet\n* Hardwell\n* Laidback Luke\n* Loadstar\n* R3hab\n* Sander van Doorn\n* Steve Angello\n* Tiesto\n* Umek\n* Zeds Dead\n\nOf those artists, Above and Beyond, Afrojack, Andy C, Avicii, Benny Benassi, Dada Life, Fury and Laidback Luke were also at EDC LA 2010.  When you go back a year further, only two names remain on the lineup: Andy C, who was also at EDC 2009, and Benny Benassi, who goes back to EDC 2008 and, presuming he keeps his streak going, will be performing at his 8th straight EDC this June.\n\nSo if you're wondering who's coming to EDC or are new to things and want to know who to listen to...it's reasonable to start here.  Nobody is \"guaranteed\" but these are your safest bets.

And then, if by chance you do get a post about Vegas, its \"Buy shuttles!\" \"Buy hotels!\" or \"Parking!\"...woo. \n* No official trailer yet.

It was amazing to finally see these artists in person.  And meet so many awesome people who loved it just as much as I did. My attitude did a total 180. The music that was becoming dull to me had life again, and just like that I was in love with it again. \n\nPsycho punks threw a flag into the crowd, my friend caught it and gave it to me. I met and danced with a ton of awesome people.  She's amazing, everybody who played at wasteland was amazing, you guys are amazing. I had a great time, and I'm back to loving my music. Thank you all.

(Long Story)","selftext":"This was my first EDC along with my girlfriend, my older brother and a girl he has been dating for months (not his gf). My girlfriend and I decided to have our \"big night\" on Friday(use your imagination) due to the amount of build up for the entire weekend being so massive. I had the chance to go to EDC LA years ago with friends and have been putting off raves ever since i hit about 16 watching all my friends have a great time. Why did I put them off? I was scared of them being to much fun for me to handle and becoming addicted to drugs/raving. In all honesty, I didn't like the scene and occasionally would bash on it. I loved hardstyle but i was a very negative person at that time in my life and I just didn't like the people associated with rave culture. Now, my brother sparked interest in all types of EDM music and Rave culutre about 2 years ago or so. I went to an Above&Beyond show about 1 year prior to EDC 2015, loved it. 3 Months later bought my EDC ticket with my girlfriend and from then on the hype was massive and my excitement and interest rocketed. My knowledge of artists was on a scale of 1-10 about a 3 and while waiting for EDC my knowledge grew to a 9 (Thanks Spotify). I can't explain enough how much both my girlfriend and I's excitement grew. I was so ready for EDC to be the first Rave and even massive festival I had been to. I had some personal feelings about this because I have been waiting for so long and I knew it was just a matter of time. My girl and I were peaking together Friday, brother and girl barely drinking or smoking. EDC was the greatest experience of my life up until Kaskade ended. I began clashing with my brother as I went to meetup with some friends at Basspod leaving Kinetic. Basically my girl and I were rolling hard, and my brother and his girl were coming down off of drinking and being super negative vibes. They were awful, we reached Basspod and they were basically about to pass out sitting on the tables. My brother showed no interest in meeting my friends or his girl introduced or anything of the nature. I felt hurt by this maybe a lot more than usual cuz those Tesla's were nice. Continuing, just met up with friends for the first time at Zomboy to get ready for Flux. Bro and his girl still sitting off to the side and my brother is known to make annoyed facial expressions. Continuing to feel these negative vibes, I tryed best to ignore them but I felt like we all waited so long for this fun that he shouldn't be acting this way. After Zomboy i just couldn't get my head around the negative vibes. I felt like the 2nd half of the night was going to shit. At least in my head. Flux was dope it could have been better b/c of the people I was with. My bro drove us that day. Immediately after Flex he books it to the exit. He is with his girl walking about 100mph to Cosmic to leave EDC. We had previously explained to him that my girl and I wanted to see Kidnap Kid for like 15min before we leave. My girl and I are trying so hard just to keep up with them as they are walking so extremely fast, idk if we were going slow but I would think your brother being at his first rave rolling balls would be grounds to slow down.. He doesn't stop for Kidnap Kid and then we reach the top of the stairs. I puked as we exited because it was so hard going up the steps trying to keep up with him. This really upset me. I ended up going off on them at like 5am after Saturday EDC. I had so many emotions about Friday and Saturday we weren't together for a minute. Saturday was more fun without them. I lost my shit when I realized how we were rolling so hard yet it got ruined. I really went off on them and took it to far calling my brother a pussy and a bitch. I said things i regret and actually really hurt his girls feelings. Which i dont care about at all cuz it's not his gf and she was mouthing off to me when I was talking to my brother and not her, also she was the biggest Debbie Downer and I just don't like her. To wrap this immensely long story up, I will say I went to EDC for the music and amazing weekend. I love music and it was all about artists for me. My bro knows alot but we like different styles forsure. My girl also kept getting really hot throughout the weekend and was complaining a bit. Not enough to really annoy me but at bad points during EDC she would bitch about heat. All in all, I did way to many drugs at EDC (all 3 days i rolled) and now feel pretty fucking depressed about how i treated my brother. I have never ever rolled 3 days in a row I would always spread out my rolls with like at least 6 months in between and feel completely fine. I dont know what happened but we completely voided our plan to stay clean for Saturday. Saturday was so much fun but we didnt roll hard or anything, and Sunday was really fun but nothing was close to the roll on Friday. It was much better on Friday for obvious reasons. We also didnt take as much on Sat/Sun as we did on Friday.. i know kind of backwards. I wasn't with my brother Sat or Sun and he ended up not rolling because of how hurt his girl was from the things i said and the then negative vibes i was spitting from my mouth towards them. I also made him cry a bit at the hotel for how bad he felt when i was saying he ruined our roll and the second half of Friday. His big day was supposed to be Sunday. I feel so horrible because it was his first EDC too just not his first rave. I wish i could re-do after Kaskade and just take a taxi home separately. I am so upset about what he and his girl did, but i feel worse about everything i said to my older brother and I now feel i ruined his Sunday. I don't know when i will get over this or if things will ever be the same with my brother again. Will going to Nocturnal help with this? Or just make things worse to keep going to these raves? I HAD SO MUCH FUN AT EDCLV other than all of this bullshit. The people i met and the love i felt from strangers was so much more than i realized. What do i DO? Say Yes and become a hard-core raver who loves this music so much more than you think and has finally broken the chain i put on myself from preventing myself to going to raves. Or go back to my old stoner self and just listen to hip-hop and decide this scene ain't for me and I am just to aggressive for it? I never thought I'd roll 3 days but it was like a no brainer to me and my girl while we were there. (I don't think I will ever do it again but boy am I excited for Tomorrowland next year...) Saturday's lineup was just to dope and we just went for it. Huge mistake? Could this be why i feel so depressed or is it deeper than that because of family?

You are probably wondering why would that have to do with anything in 2016? Well for each tour, they started during the festival period (April-Aug) of the prior year. For ***Alive 2007***, their tour started on *April 29, 2006* at **Coachella** and then *June 30, 2006* at **Eurock√©ennes de Belfort 2006** (http://www.setlist.fm/setlists/daft-punk-bd6d5a2.html?page=6)\n\nThe previous tour of ***Alive 1997*** they also started around the time frame of April-August.

Whom could also start their tour with a HUGE BANG! Second, you might be questioning the odds since they have not make any buzz after making ***Random Access Memories*** but they are actually in progress of making a follow up [album](http://www.youredm.com/2015/04/20/daft-punk-rumored-to-be-working-on-new-album-would-be-released-via-tidal/) which is probably due next year and with that, it help spurs the momentum of them starting the tour in 2016.

I want to hear everyone's euphoric moments, and know that we will be ready for next weekend.\n\nFor me, my feels trip was last year during Above & Beyond. After discovering the group a bit after Group Therapy, I immediately fell in love with their music and the power behind them. I knew everyone said A&B can make you cry, but I didn't know everyone actually meant it. Before EDC last year, I had a lot of things going on for me. I was 1 year away from graduating college, JUST moved out of my parents house into my boyfriend's home, and learning how to be my own person. During those months leading up to EDC, I had a bit of doubt in my head, asking myself if I really can make it. The one song I always played that helped me was [You Got To Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdXbJptvos). The one line that always hits me hard is \"Dream on little dreamer\". The song always meant the world to me, but I didn't expect it to get to me during EDC last year.\n\nIt was my first time seeing them, and I was absolutely excited for it. My boyfriend joined me, and we found a spot center far in the back of the stage. The music began and the words \"We are Above & Beyond\" faded onto the screen. My heart began to jump. Their intro was so beautiful, and right off the bat they tore into it. At one point, The vocals for Satellite began, and I damn near screamed the words. The song has always been my 2nd favorite. I wasn't expecting it, and right before the drop I wiped a tear away. My emotions finally began to expand and I was connected. Before I knew what happened, the screen went dark, and the words \"Dreams Come True\" formed before the words to [You Got To Believe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w39eLEmgi78) played. I literally fell to my knees and began SOBBING. All of the struggles/problems/worries I had been feeling about my life were literally pouring out of my eyes. My boyfriend held my hand tight and held me, but I was beyond okay. I was crying out of happiness, but I truly believe that my soul needed to have that moment. I spent the rest of the set wiping my eyes, but it was the first time music has ever hit me like that. \n\nWhat about you all?

I was inspired to post this after reading user Perrykgreene's post about his lost and found experience. **Feel free to share your experiences as well.**\n\nDay 1 and 2 blew me away. All of the stages took me by surprise and the colors that filled the night made me feel like I had escaped into a whole new world. Every moment had fallen into place. Best of all, we found Kaskade at the ancient mayan car and danced til sunrise. Amongst spontaneously running into old friends, catching the fireworks from the perfect view, and watching memorable sets, I had a mind-blowing experience my first 2 days. I was overwhelmed with good vibes and felt blessed to be around great friends, people, smiles, love, and music. \n\n\nAs day 3 came along, my bf and I were feeling a bit burnt out, but we still wanted to have a good time. I couldn't help but feel some bad vibes on this day.\n\n* ~11pm-12:30am: Entered the venue, went on the ferris wheel by circuit grounds, had a smoothie, chilled by the wedding chapel. This is when we noticed our car keys were missing. My heart dropped and we began retracing our steps. Eventually we gave up and stood in line at lost and found for an hour. They didn't have a key that matched our description. I felt so hopeless and began to think of every bad scenario in my head. Since this was a rental car, I was more scared. There was no possible way we could enjoy ourselves. \n\n* ~4:15am: Back in line at lost and found. Workers tell us they're moving everything to the exterior location and will reopen there. We left and waited by the parking lot for the new lost and found to re-open.\n\n* ~5-5:30am: We describe our keys to the worker and he has a perfect match. Grey Hyundai Elantra, rental car, there's 3 items on the keys: clicker, key, and keychain w/ the car's info. The worker *doesn't* give us the keys. We rented the car from Hertz, but he apparently had record of the car being rented from another company (I don't know how, the key chain didn't give out that information). My bf and I hung onto each other and sluggishly walked back to our car and sat in the shade the car casted onto the dirty, hard blacktop.\n\n* 6am: Fed up. Decide to go back and wait in the exterior lost and found line again. I wait about 1 hour in the sun. The line has not moved AT ALL since I arrived and I start to sob. I was so desperate, I go up to a girl near the front of the line and offer her money to ask them if they have my keys. She comes back to me and says the same thing that the worker told me the first time I was in line around 5 am. Something didn't feel right.\n\n* 7:15am: Ran back, sobbing, to my bf across the parking lot. No service, no one to call, no way to get home. 80% of the lot was empty with a few people hanging around bumping music. A group close by us offers us water. They asked us what was wrong and we explained our situation. One of the girls had service and helped me call roadside assistance while the guys consoled my boyfriend. They were so helpful, I remember them saying \"this is what raves are all about\". Roadside assistance said that within 1 hour, a tow truck will come and tow us to the airport where we could trade our car for a new one. The group of people that helped us eventually left. We were super thankful for them. \n\n* ~8:30am: No sign of tow truck. Sitting in silence, hot wind blowing trash everywhere. At a very low point now. Security on golf carts kept passing us, asking why we hadn't left. One offers us a ride to lost and found. We check one last time. We arrive and describe our keys again, and the worker (a different one) says she has them. It was the exact pair of keys I was denied twice. I started crying again, at this point I was sleep deprived, angry at the man earlier who didn't give me the keys, and furious because my bf and I could have had our keys back at 5 am, but instead we had to wait another several hours crying and depressed in the sun.\n\n* ~9am: Security guy gives us a ride back to our car, gives us free Powerade. My bf and I are sitting on the back of the golf cart, beyond exhausted and crying. An unfortunate experience that I still can't wrap my head around. Thank you to whoever turned those keys in, you can't imagine how relieved we were to sit in our car again and be a little bit closer to home.\n\nDespite having an unpleasant 3rd day and not seeing any sets, my boyfriend and I came to the realization that life needs to have a balance of good and bad. The bad always ends up happening for a reason, though. Looking back now, the lost key situation brought me closer to people and I couldn't be more thankful for them. People are really good at heart, and are always willing to help others out. I saw these kinds of people like this over the weekend, and this is a philosophy that should be lived every day, not just during weekends like this. \n\nThank you EDC, possibly one of the best weekends of my life.

I submitted this to my FB friends for them to look over, and I felt like y'all will appreciate it. :) I know most of the info here is pretty well-known to you all, but this was written for mostly people who had no idea about anything involving EDM/rave culture. HERE WE GO:\n\nI suppose I didn‚Äôt really have any solid expectations when I began my journey to Las Vegas this past weekend. I knew this was a massive festival‚ÄîI‚Äôd seen commercials and trailers and clips from previous years‚Äîbut it still didn‚Äôt hit me until I actually got there. It started to sink in when my plane landed and the entire cabin burst into applause and a minutes-long chant of ‚ÄúE-D-C! E-D-C! E-D-C!‚Äù It kept sinking in when I was walking through the airport and signs everywhere said ‚ÄúLas Vegas welcomes Electric Daisy Carnival.‚Äù And it really started to sink in when I noticed about ¬æ of the people I saw at the airport wearing the admission wristband, basically your ticket into the Carnival itself. This was going to be huge on a scale I never would have fathomed.\n\nIf you looked at me on a normal day, you wouldn‚Äôt typically see a partier. I just got a Master‚Äôs degree in English, so my days are spent reading and teaching other people how to read and write well, and my nights are filled with browsing the internet, cooking healthy meals, and chatting with friends. All in all, pretty low-key. Even on the rare occasions I do go out to bars, I stand on the sidelines, drinking water, not dancing at all, generally keeping to myself. There‚Äôs a shyness that tends to come out of me when I‚Äôm surrounded by strangers, as though I do what I can to ensconce myself in the familiarity of isolation, the known aspect of self, rather than flinging myself out into the void of strangers. But I knew, as I was waiting in line to check into my hotel and I saw people decked out in neon clothes or EDC shirts or body paint, that my usual routine was something I‚Äôd have to put to the side this weekend. I was going to have to either put on a confident and outgoing persona, or take off the insecure and quiet persona I usually had on. I wasn‚Äôt sure which would be more accurate at the beginning, and I‚Äôm even less sure now that I look back in retrospect which actually happened.\n\nI‚Äôm not going to bore you with the details of checking into my hotel room, or trying to decide what to wear. I‚Äôm not even going to talk about the shuttles to the festival and the people I met on the bus, or the secret military base we had to drive through to get to the venue, or even the stringent security protocols that put a solid hour between getting off the bus and getting into the Carnival. This is going to be about lessons learned within, and solely within, the Carnival. Under the electric sky, as my fellow ravers put it. The lessons are:\n\n1.\tHave a piece of candy every now and again.\n\n2.\tRally under your flag.\n\n3.\tEmbrace vulnerability.\n\n4.\tDon‚Äôt hesitate to refill.\n\n5.\tSeek and ye shall find.\n\nThese may seem strange and vague, but the meaning behind each of these phrases is a profound lesson that was brought into sharp relief by the light of the Electric Daisy Carnival and the people within it. Let‚Äôs begin:\n\n**1. Have a piece of candy every now and again.**\n\nUsually I am pretty strict about my nutrition. I have goals regarding my physique and I do what I can to take steps every day to bring those goals to fruition. Vegetables, lean proteins, only drinking water. I don‚Äôt particularly enjoy super-sweet foods anymore, and even when I do break on the strictness usually I feel so guilty that I‚Äôm immediately back on it by the next meal. But EDC taught me to let go every now and again, in a number of different ways.\n\nFor starters, in perhaps the most obvious method‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt care about what I ate in Vegas. I at one point almost ate a complete 16‚Äù pizza in a single meal. The concept of nutrients or macro breakdowns didn‚Äôt exist. I didn‚Äôt worry about if I was getting enough protein, I just ate. And it was glorious to have that part of myself turned off for a few days. Am I going to keep that up? No, but I needed the mental vacation.\n\nPoint the second, shyness does not and in many ways cannot exist at Electric Daisy Carnival. That‚Äôs a massive difference from other festivals I‚Äôve been to, like Warped Tour‚Äîthe crowd energy is much different. I remarked upon this several times that Warped has this sense of tenuous community, and the atmosphere is one of happiness and celebration but simmering underneath that is a brooding and nearly-predatory survival instinct, a defiance of social norms with bared teeth and a come-and-get-it glare. There isn‚Äôt a whole lot of speaking done, people are focused on getting to their sets and their stages. Not so at EDC. I have never been given so many high fives, hugs, compliments, or asked genuine questions by complete strangers in my entire life. 135,000 people every night attended this festival and I saw only one upset person the entire weekend. People are dead-set on having a great time, extending positive vibes to everyone else. Sharing parts of themselves, whether that‚Äôs through just talking or giving something away that they created, like kandi.\n\nYes, kandi. Of the people reading this who attended EDC or are otherwise into the EDM culture, you‚Äôll know what I‚Äôm talking about (and you‚Äôll get the pun!). I personally had no idea what it was when I got to Vegas, or even really when I‚Äôd made it to the festival, but by the end of the weekend my wrist was absolutely covered in elastic wristbands with plastic beads strung over them. These bracelets are called, collectively, ‚Äúkandi,‚Äù and each individual bracelet is called a ‚Äúpiece.‚Äù People show up to EDC with both arms from wrist to shoulder absolutely covered in their own kandi, and they give pieces away to people they find interesting or cool. Whether you‚Äôve just been talking for a couple minutes, you‚Äôve danced really well, or you just find yourself wanting this person to remember you for some reason, you give them a piece of kandi using a handshake that revolves around the four tenets of EDM culture: Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect. Shortened to PLUR by most enthusiasts, these four ideologies of existence come to an incredible and visceral fruition in those who engage in the culture.\n\nIt was my first EDC, so that was reason enough for people to give me kandi. It was my first rave at all, so that was an added reason for people to give me kandi. I did what I could to reciprocate when I had the ability, but I was blown away by the time and effort that went into these little pieces of non-valued sociocultural capital. It isn‚Äôt as though the more kandi you have, the cooler you are, but it‚Äôs still apropos to have at least a few of those brightly colored bracelets on your wrist, if only to signal to others that you‚Äôre into sharing, giving back, and connecting with everyone.\n\nThis entire vacation became a piece of candy for me, an oasis of hedonism in a life marked by regimentation and routine. I found comfort in the chaos, I found connection in strangers, and I couldn‚Äôt have done this without that strong EDM community keeping it all glued firmly together. The helpfulness and genuine care that other people give you is something I‚Äôm going to keep trying to emulate in my everyday experience. I‚Äôm generally bound to my ambition and my pride, but EDC taught me that letting loose every now and again isn‚Äôt going to kill me‚Äîin fact, it‚Äôs probably better for me if I do.\n\n**2. Rally under your flag.**\n\nComing into EDC on the first night, I knew one other person and he was not physically with me. I was entirely alone with nobody and nothing to really allow myself the connection that I saw manifesting among other people. Luckily, I ran into two teenagers from Switzerland who‚Äôd flown out for the festival who, when I explained to them my predicament, immediately said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre with us now, let‚Äôs go party,‚Äù and took me with them to several different DJs‚Äô sets. I‚Äôd never heard of these DJ‚Äôs before, and frankly they were good, but I was stunned that these two guys in a completely different country would adopt a loner and a newbie, without a second‚Äôs hesitation, into their own fold. It didn‚Äôt matter that I was unaware of most of the artists playing, or that I didn‚Äôt know how festivals of this size worked, or even that it was my first rave. They saw a guy that was stressing out and they wanted me to have a good time, so they took it upon themselves to show me one.\n\nThat‚Äôs a pattern I thought could never continue, and yet it inexplicably did. Until my buddy got to the festival that night, I was ‚Äúadopted‚Äù by group after group after group, and they all were immediately accepting of a new person within their ranks. Nobody gave me the stink eye for being the odd man out, nobody asked any probing questions about why I was alone. They all expressed the sentiment of ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre here, we‚Äôre here, we‚Äôre gonna have a good time,‚Äù and just lived that out every second. When Kevin finally showed up, they adopted him too. Just about every single person I met there welcomed everyone else with open arms, open minds, and open hearts.\n\nAnd that is despite the varied and multiple backgrounds that everyone brought to the table. I met bankers, lawyers, PhD students in physics, engineers, college kids and high school dropouts alike‚Äîall gathered together at the Carnival to celebrate their lives. People from all over the world, speaking different languages and liking different music, still put aside their differences to come together. I met people from Australia, Switzerland, China, Canada, California, Georgia, Seattle, Albuquerque. All of them were there for the same reasons and wanted the same things. Everyone wanted to give and receive PLUR. \n\nBut it‚Äôs hard to maintain a group of any size without something common to rally around. To that effect, groups counteracted this general lost-ness with ‚Äútotems,‚Äù or images on sticks that groups would decide upon collectively and hold up high to see over a crowd. These totems could be signs (MY MOM THINKS I‚ÄôM AT SUMMER CAMP), they could be faces of completely random people (one guy had his face as a totem, another girl had Tom Skerritt as hers), but most inspiringly, they could be flags. Watching those flags wave, dotted in the insanely large crowds in front of massive stages and laser light shows, was really something to behold. Whether it was a state flag, a country flag, a pride flag or a college flag, it really brought something home for me.\n\nUsually, people in this world want to help you. Even though it‚Äôs easy to be cynical, most people are out to make sure everyone else wins. Maybe that‚Äôs really not the case and I‚Äôm being na√Øve, but whether it is or not‚Äîthere still will be a few people whom you‚Äôll find a closer bond with, people you want to keep around. There‚Äôs something that ties you together, whether it‚Äôs where you went to school, what movies you like, the place you live or the families you have. That becomes something to look for over the furor of everyday activity, something to regroup and refocus around. In the night you see it, waving high, lit up and magnified by its importance to you. Come together under your totem. Rally around your flag, and find yourself again. A comfort amidst the frenetic unknown.\n\n(continued in comments--I know it's long, sorry D:)"},"3ax3gw":{"author":"ElectricDazey","id":"3ax3gw","created_utc":1435122301,"num_comments":2,"score":6,"title":"Deorro","selftext":"I just have to say his set was absolutely insane on Sunday.

Bought VIP tickets for $500 per and didn't feel they were worth it vs. general admin (which was still in the $200's then).\n\n2013:\n \nPros: Everything.  Had a blast with basic GA tickets.  Major Lazer killed it on Cosmic Meadow.\nCons: None :)\n\n2014:  \nPros: Friday and Saturday were amazing and then Sunday we got hooked up big time with all access passes.  Met Pasquale and Holly, got to watch Kinetic from the Sky Decks, free booze, etc.  Very lucky.\nCons: For whatever reason there were just a lot of groups of dudes who seemed more interested in hitting on girls and getting wasted then the music.  I was worried it was getting too mainstream but I really didn't notice that any other year, including this one.\n\n2015:  \nPros: Fellow EDC go'ers were awesome.  Music was great.  Actually thought traffic getting there was the best it's been in four years.\nCons: Maybe I'm being picky but there were a few things that irritated me this year.  I just didn't love having to wear a wristband for three days straight.  I actually did like it better than the credit card type of ticket, but I wish it had been removable during the day time.  \n\nAnother thing was that I had two bad experiences with staff (one of which caused us to miss Krewella's entire set).  Apparently the security lines all move at different speeds depending on how thorough each individual security staffer is.  We got in line at 10:15 and didn't get through until after 11:25!  I saw an insomniac employee standing there and told him the line I was in was way too slow (other lines next to us were moving three times as fast and some people in our line were jumping the barricades into the other lines).  He flat out admitted to me that the line I was in was ridiculously slow and that he was sorry but it's up to the security staff to operate at whatever pace they feel fit.  \n\nI also stood in line for awhile to buy a hat on Sunday night.  When I got to the front, I guess the guy helping my line went on break.  No one replaced him.  When I asked the guy next to him if I could get a hat, he told me he couldn't help me because I wasn't in his line.  When I told him \"I've been waiting in line and whoever helped the guy infront of me just walked off.  So now I'm supposed to get into a different line?\"  He just kind of shrugged his shoulders and said \"sorry\"\n\nLastly, and I wonder if anyone else will agree with this.... the last three years I was always in awe of how they could have all these stages with all this music and yet at no time anywhere did I ever notice two sounds in the same space.  This year, I feel like they changed the layout for what I assume was to fit more people on Kinetic.  And it was at the expense of that.  Not directly at the stages themselves, but when walking around the rides and art areas you could clearly hear two different stages at once in some places.  Never noticed that before.\n\nFortunately I didn't experience the delay Sunday night to get in or the Bass Pod power outage.\n\nMaybe after 4 events and a couple of really outstanding experiences, my expectations were set too high...."},"3b1wuo":{"author":"EDCLVK","id":"3b1wuo","created_utc":1435221134,"num_comments":6,"score":1,"title":"I want to hear from the ones that stayed in two bedroom suites whether it be at a hotel or at one of the condo type places.","selftext":"Where did you stay and how did you like it?

There is no other guy who is so supportive of his headliners and is so socially active in the community...\n\nYet people of course will still bitch and moan. Don't blame insomniac. Sure it's easy to blame them cause it's insomniac's name on the line. But they are forced because of growing demand of EDM music. Nevada and the surrounding businesses/hotels/rentalfees/Etc are forcing the prices up. Insomniac is doing what it must to give us a great show and a great experience year after year. Cause to be honest insomniac can never go back down in production value. The community just won't let it happen. Well if you want bigger and better then shit you may have to pay a little more each year. Get over it. Its how the world works now a days.\n\n\nBlame all the people who didn't finish there plans last year. That's why the 30$ has been put in place i'm assuming(no proof no proof). After they said no additional tics will be sold last year they were forced to release thousands of tickets because people didn't complete their payment plans to whatever the reason may be.\n\nAlso about the shuttle situation. IMO year after year the shuttle system slowly evolves into a better system.  Yes every year there is some sort of issue that arises that pisses people off... well guess what, i'm sure it pisses Insomniac off too but they probably have very little control over some of the mistakes that happen because they just happened.  \n\nInsomniac spends a lot of time figuring out how they run things and this year it seems they have decided to drop some hotel locations and limit the stops.  Now sure you may automatically assume shit less locations means longer lines.  OR you can think about it as less locations means MORE buses per location and possible LESS of a hold up.   Sure the lines may grow some but that doesn't mean the lines are going to be HOURS longer simply because the line grew in length.  A steady flow of buses would lead to faster transportation possibly.\n\nInsomniac has crews who sole job is to figure this type of stuff out.  They work on next year EDC LV right after the previous EDCLV ends.  Its their flag ship event..they are doing everything they can to make it the best for us Headliners.\n\n**Have a great weekend everyone and hope to see everyone next year at the 20th year celebration!

I see a lot of people asking about ADA and wheelchairs and crutches. I just wanted to share my experience. I know some friends who will down vote this for my honesty, but if I had heard more than just go it will be fine you will have a blast, I might have been a little more prepared. \n\nI bought my tickets the day they went on sale for 2015. We had already booked and paid for our hotel and flight when I had my accident in April. Devastated that I might have to miss edc, I contacted ADA and came to Reddit for advice. I was told there were special viewing platforms, special shuttles, there would be a golf cart that would take me from stage to stage among other things. By June, I was just starting to be weight bearing (my knee is destroyed- but the broken tibial plateau was the first step) set off to Vegas with crutches and a wheelchair and thought it was going to be a cake walk going to edc. \n\nI decided to use crutches the whole time BC my wheelchair had problems with unleveled gravel - motorized wheelchairs shouldn't have this problem.  The first night I went to the shuttles 30 minutes early BC I didn't know what to expect. I told them I needed the Ada shuttle and waited. 10 minutes before they leave a group of about 15 people with 1 wheelchair arrived and when boarding started I was told I couldn't use the only shuttle bus I could get on BC the group of 15 were taking up all the space. I had to literally pull myself up the stairs of the bus to be able to get on. After that, I became more vocal and did not have the same problems with a shuttle again. Also, by the third day people start to remember you so it gets easier each day. \n\nI never once got to use the cart that went from stage to stage. Walking at edc was EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. The stages are far apart, there are a lot of people, there is trash everywhere by day 3, and honestly crutches for a mile is tiring. People broke into the handicapped bathrooms and destroyed them. No different than any other bathroom, but there was only 1 handicapped stall per bathroom section and when you have to prop yourself up to pee it would be nice if other people's shit wasn't everywhere. More than once I had a panic attack BC I thought I would never be able to get through the crowd, at least twice I had to pee where I was because I physically could not get to the bathroom - there were too many people.  I have no problems popping a squat but doing with a broken knee, crutches, people everywhere, wearing shorts, and being fucked up is an art.\n\nPeople were very nice for the most part. There were a few assholes, but mostly when people saw me they helped me (surprisingly men much more than women). When they saw me is the key phrase. I was bumped into, tripped, hit, knocked over because people weren't paying attention to where they were waking or what they were doing. One time a guy in front of me walking decided to start dancing and kicked me. It was always unintentional and always so apologetic afterwards, but you don't think about that until you can't walk. I will honestly say I know I don't pay attention when I am at festivals and feeling good so I can't blame them, but it adds to the difficulties of getting around. One girl I met was crying BC she was in a wheelchair and people kept falling all over her and knocked her out of her chair. \n\nThe Ada stage became my safe zone. I had a chair to prop my leg on and rails that I could hold on to so I could dance. I didn't care what stage we were at as long as I was near the Ada stage. Without that stage edc would have been impossible to get through the first hour, let alone be able to see the sun rise on the third day. Ground control and the people helping the Ada really do whatever they can to help you out. The problem is it's a big festival and they have limited resources. They got me water whenever they could - which was only a handful of times, my boyfriend went above and beyond and catered to my every need, and the other people at the Ada stage - I have never seen a more caring group of people. They all treated each other with such love - maybe because we understood the struggle, maybe because that's the nature of the event, maybe because they are just that awesome of people - we helped each other out as much as possible without words being said. And for people like my boyfriend, other SO's, and friends who made the experience possible - they had to put someone else's needs above their own the entire festival. That is love. That is unity. It still brings tears to my eyes thinking about everything everyone did so I could have fun. \n\nI remember the guy who told me he was going to part the crowd like the Red Sea for me - and did. I remember the people who did like a telephone line to get the attention of a guy with a spray bottle fan (best moment ever). I remember the glovers who would climb up the railing to give me a light show. I remember all the people who showed me love and kindness.\n\n\nTL;DR\nADA at edc is not easy. It's difficult and frustrating. But it is worth it. And I will be back in 2016. I hope I can walk by then, but if I can't, learning from this year I will be ready. I hope this post helps someone else get ready.
