Love was last years theme, but I feel like Love is always a theme, or at the very least, a contributing feeling associated with EDC. Just like Peace, Unity, Respect, Equality, Acceptance, etc. Was the theme carried throughout all of the festival more so that usual?\n\nAs I said, I love EDC, and I love the hype train leading up to EDC every year, it‚Äôs just something I noticed and didn‚Äôt understand. \n\nTL;DR Why does it matter what this years theme is?

Anyway, this was my 4th EDC and For some reason I have to say that this EDC really stuck with me more than the others. (With the exception of my 1st EDC experience for obvious reasons)\n\nI remember coming back from my first EDC with crazy withdrawals and I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it for months. I was excited for the following two years and it was a great time, but I never really missed it like I did the very first time. However coming back home now, I‚Äôm feeling like that again. Like I‚Äôm just thinking of all the good memories, people we met, just everything. I‚Äôm telling myself just yesterday I was at EDC. Crazy I‚Äôm back home.\n\nIt was just me, my girlfriend and a cool group of people we met on the last day. I usually always went with a group of 10 people and even more sometimes so this was a complete change. I felt like the lineup was good, but not great in comparison to the previous years, however, was completely eclipsed with the fact that how good and consistent most of the sets were. This was also the first time I went to Vegas as a 21 year old who booked his very own hotel himself and bought plenty of drinks to flash my expired drivers license haha. Nobody cared! I went to my first EDC Vegas as soon as I graduated high school back in 2015 and haven‚Äôt missed a year yet for reference\n\nI didn‚Äôt even want to go at all this year because of how much money I would have to spend, but my girlfriend really wanted to because this was her second time. We went last year together with a big group, but we didn‚Äôt really know each other. We started dating soon after we got back haha. So this trip was kind of like a special one year anniversary, well if it were in June, but close enough. The weather was definitely worth having it in May. However, I am not sure if I will go again next year just because I feel more than satisfied with the times I have went and would rather use that money for other endeavors. Who knows, I‚Äôve been saying that the past couple years\n\nI just had to get this off my chest because I can‚Äôt stop thinking about the past weekend. I don‚Äôt usually feel this emotional often.

I would love to see him at Circuit Grounds, etc. That being said... in general the lineup is not up to par with last year's.

A lot of folks seem to be looking for recommendations, so this might be a good chance to give your own!  \n  \nI'm going to start with me... for obvious reasons.  \n  \nFirst, a little about me: I've been listening to electronic music since 1996. Before that, I listened to a lot of hip hop like A Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul and similar, which lead to scratching and breaks. I went to my first rave in 1998. Since then, I've been to dozens of real, actual raves, dozens of commercial style raves (like EDC both before it was in Vegas and the first time it went to Vegas, Beyond Wonderland, Escape From Wonderland, etc.), Coachella when it didn't totally fucking suck and had a lot more electronic music, other random festivals, countless club shows, The Love Parade (twice), and I'm probably forgetting more. Needless to say, I've been to tons and tons of shows, and I'm pretty old (at least, compared to most of you).  \n  \nAs I mentioned, I started mainly with scratching and break type stuff, then went into a trance phase, then I moved to Chicago so I got really into house (basically, forced into it if you know Chicago). All the while there was drum and bass kind of in the background.  \n  \nAround 1999 I started listening to a lot more jungle and drum and bass and that has basically consumed my musical preference since. I still like old trance and quite a bit of house, and I even appreciated some of the dubstep that was coming out in the mid 00's by Caspa, Skream, Rusko, and the gang (the first time I heard Caspa's remix of TC's \"Where's My Money\" I actually thought it was a joke track).  \n  \nI have a full DJing setup with production stuff and all that jazz. I have been mixing since I started fucking around with Traktor in 2003 without any physical equipment. I've never played a show. I obviously prefer to mix dnb, but can do pretty much anything at this point.   \n\nWithout further ado, here's what I am stoked about on the lineup by day. Some, INSANELY STOKED ABOUT despite having seen most of the DJs.  \n  \nFriday: Calyx &amp; Teebee B2B Break (holy shit), Pendulum, and Redlight. I'll also be interested to check out Dash Berlin, Flux Pavillion B2B Doctor P (please play old shit), and Kaskade (my girlfriends favorite).  \n  \nSaturday: Andy C, Green Velvet presents La La Land (my favorite techno guy), Loadstar B2B Mind Vortex, and Shimon B2B Benny L. I'd like to check out Andrew Bayer, Digweed, and Tiesto.\n \nSunday: Caspa, DJ Hype B2B Hazard (my favorite DJ who runs my favorite label B2B with my favorite producer... HOLY SHIT), Drumsound &amp; Bassline Smith, Ferry Corsten (my favorite trance guy), Paul Van Dyk, The Prototypes B2B TC, and Tantrum Desire. I'd like to check out ATB, Boys Noize, Cosmic Gate, Dash Berlin (again? whoa), and Loco Dice.  \n  \nLet me know if you guys have any suggestions for things I should check out! I am obviously into darker stuff these days, and tend to go towards techno rather than house and trance. Don't be shy!  \n  \nAnd post your own lists, because I want to see what ya'll are excited for! Party time, woo!  \n\nI don't know if this has been done already. Searching is difficult.

This year Friday only has 7 listed, Sat has 9, while sun has 8.\n\nI have a hunch at least two more artists will be annouced as late ads / special guests. One friday, which could be a relatively small artist as the lineup that day is already stacked.\n\nSunday is more way interesting though, I don't believe there is someone listed that has had the year to warrant the 1:30 Am headliner time slot. They could give it to Zedd because of Stay and The Middle but EDC has traditionally not rewarded commercial success to the point that they would make him the headliner of the whole festival. The stage he played and his set time at Escape from Wonderland would indicate to me that they don't think of Zedd as a headliner similar to the likes of DJ Snake, Calvin Harris, SHM, etc. (He did not play the mainstage, and he did not play last on the stage that he did play).... They could give it to Afrojack or Dash but thats even more unlikely.\n\nI think they have something special planned for Sunday the question is what it is - Another Night owl experience, Swedish House Mafia (EDC would have to wait until after Ultra to announce them most likely), or someone else entirely. \n\nThere are probably only 5 - 10 artists that could hold down that spot that aren't already on the lineup, but your guess is as good as mine. Who knows, maybe Zedd does get the spot after all. \n\nWhy do it like this: They have to keep up with Ultra which is going all out this year, they want to make a splash the first year of the festival being in May, and if they announce one or two big name artists about a month before the festival it will boost ticket sales. EDC did not sell out last year and I am sure they do not want to make that a pattern, this could be part of their solution.\n\nWhat does everyone think?\n","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"electricdaisycarnival","subreddit_id":"t5_2srd1","subreddit_type":"public","thumbnail":"self","title":"Stage Lineups by Day (Friday and Sunday Seem Light - SHM?)","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/834qg2/stage_lineups_by_day_friday_and_sunday_seem_light/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"},{"author":"jake_dots","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_type":"text","brand_safe":true,"can_mod_post":false,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1520531119,"domain":"self.electricdaisycarnival","full_link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/82zdec/does_anyone_have_any_guesses_on_when_theyre_gonna/","gilded":0,"id":"82zdec","is_crosspostable":true,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"num_comments":14,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/82zdec/does_anyone_have_any_guesses_on_when_theyre_gonna/","pinned":false,"retrieved_on":1520580393,"rte_mode":"markdown","score":5,"selftext":"i‚Äôm tryna plan out my trip but i can‚Äôt until i see the lineup üòÇ","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"electricdaisycarnival","subreddit_id":"t5_2srd1","subreddit_type":"public","thumbnail":"self","title":"does anyone have any guesses on when they‚Äôre gonna announce the edc week lineup??","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/82zdec/does_anyone_have_any_guesses_on_when_theyre_gonna/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"},{"author":"NotNotJustinBieber","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_type":"text","brand_safe":true,"can_mod_post":false,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1520306680,"domain":"self.electricdaisycarnival","edited":1520308053,"full_link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/82bzme/favorite_songs_off_the_edc_lineup_this_year/","gilded":0,"id":"82bzme","is_crosspostable":true,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"num_comments":31,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/82bzme/favorite_songs_off_the_edc_lineup_this_year/","pinned":false,"post_hint":"self","preview":{"enabled":false,"images":[{"id":"5kfdGrSM7WKi4OiT8xhJjczyBIC3J29DroAoGsaZPR0","resolutions":[{"height":81,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/BMDtNuWXKiaABS0UxBgAxuBfwMaqLWufji1JgvS_iAU.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;fm=jpg&amp;s=ef0f40493486dc9b33099ee13708b3ad","width":108},{"height":162,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/BMDtNuWXKiaABS0UxBgAxuBfwMaqLWufji1JgvS_iAU.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;fm=jpg&amp;s=7a3c7f266115f129dbd6edf9d77a0dac","width":216},{"height":240,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/BMDtNuWXKiaABS0UxBgAxuBfwMaqLWufji1JgvS_iAU.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;fm=jpg&amp;s=9b9612a96b9ae0f849937bc83dc36020","width":320}],"source":{"height":360,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/BMDtNuWXKiaABS0UxBgAxuBfwMaqLWufji1JgvS_iAU.jpg?fm=jpg&amp;s=98aacaa4e73b3fb61c152ec8e16c8614","width":480},"variants":{}}]},"retrieved_on":1520363624,"rte_mode":"markdown","score":15,"selftext":"So what‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs favorite songs from the EDC lineup this year?\n\nJust a few:\n\n[Seven Lions - Calling You Home](https://youtu.be/r5y1V-NLsmg) \n\n[Virtual Self - Particle Arts](https://youtu.be/Unw_45QBxvs) \n\n[Dubvision &amp;

I don't even recognize a lot of the usernames anymore like I used to! But for all you new comers, I wanted to give my two cents(probably more lol) on how what EDc meant/means to me, and how it affected me after going.\n\nIn February 2015 I came across a lineup ad for some thing called \"EDC New York\" while I was sitting in my morning class for \"Love and Sex in the French Culture\" (college was a fun, strange time ;P). I was bored in class and was looking to see Bassnectar with my buddy sometime in the next few months, and saw he was playing at this festival, along with a ton of other DJs that I'd always wanted to see. I had never been to a music festival and had really only been into EDM since 2012, but this caught my eye. I start looking into it and realize the festival isn't far from our friends house in New Jersey.. Gears start going and next thing I know I'm texting my best friend, and the other mutual friend (who lives near Met Life stadium) to see if we could plan a fantasy trip to this festival. I research more and more and find that I apprarently had been living under a rock: EDC NY was a small festival compared to its parent, EDC LV...one of the biggest EDM festivals in the world. My friend and finally bite the bullet and get tickets for ourselves to go to eDC NY in May 2015. \n\nWe find out netflix has a documentary on this festival, and watch it to get us pumped for EDC NY, knowing that we could never go to the ACTUAL EDC LV, but enjoying the fact thatd we'd get a taste of it with EDC NY. Finally, after what seemed like forever, May came around and us Massachusetts boys headed for NYC to have our minds blown....and boy were they blown.\n\nFor two days I was at my first  music festival, and was in over my head in the most incredible way possible. The sets were amazing, the sights were indescribable, and the emotions felt became forever ingrained in my heart and memories. We finished the weekend and I immediately knew i needed more....i wanted the forbidden fruit. I wanted EDC Las Vegas!\n\nI gave it a few weeks to come back to reality, and finally texted my closest friends, most of whom were barely into EDM and hadn't even been to a rave/edm concert...and came up with this crazy idea: not 2015, and not even 2016, but in 2017 if we save for the next two years, the 5 of us can go to Las Vegas, and go to the biggest party we could ever dream of, and have one of the most incredible weeks of our lives!\n\nAside from the one who went to EDC NY with me, the guys were skeptical....still, I kept pushing them. Finally, by the end of the summer, the entire group decided (fuck it, let's do something crazy, and let's do it fucking RIGHT\". We would save for two years so we could be ballers that were way out of our element in LAs Vegas, but you wouldn't know it lookin at us! I frequented this sub every day for two years. Watched not one, but two EDC LV's (and all other EDC's!) go by while i anxiously waited for our time to come. \n\nAlong the way another friend joined to make our group 6. We had people in our group move to different states, had some of us drop out of college, some of us graduate, girlfriends changed, lives changed (a lot can happen in over two years!), but the thing that stayed the same was we all were going to EDC LV 2017. Finally June rolled around, and we were fucking READY. We had everything that could be planned planned to a T.\n\nWe stayed in a dope suite at the Venetian, and stayed from the Wednesday before EDC to the Tuesday after. We went to the Rehab pool party the Thursday before (absolutely amazing I cant recommend rehab enough!!! such a fun pregame!). We gambled, we partied, we had the time of our lives. EDC came and I made sure to give it absolutely everything i had for those three nights i had literally been waiting years for. It was different than I expected, but impacted me significantly nonetheless. There of course were speed bumps (some of us got along better than others, our airline lost our luggage from Wednesday to Friday morning, two of our Camelbaks broke on day 1, etc.) But it was still some of my most incredible memories in my life so far (I'm 23 now, 24 later this year).\n\nAfter EDC many of us went our separate ways for a while, which was expected....this was a bit of a last blow out bash for all of us together since some of us lived in different time zones by that point. I had a bit of a cathartic experience and shut myself away from this sub and didnt listen to any EDM for months, not because of a bad time but....after over two years of anticipation, followed by a release over a single weekend, you feel changed for a while.\n\nFinally by mid august I was coming back to normal again and leveled out. Of the six of us, only one is going back to this years EDC. I would like to go back in a couple years with my girlfriend. The experiences that were had at EDC changed me as a person, and helped me find myself a bit more. It made me finally come to acceptance with the next chapter in my life after graduating college only a month before.\n\nSome of you reading this will having similar experiences, some will have vastly different ones. But one thing I can say and give as advice to all you first timers: enjoy your time there, make every second count, because it does. Make sure you take time to realize where you are, in that moment, with all those thousands of others, sharing this one monumental experience together. Let yourself know that you deserve the reward you have all worked so hard for to be there, and know that somewhere down the line, well after the last stages have come down, and new stages may be going up, many of you will look back and say \"wow, those were some of the best memories of my life....\" Have fun all, and remember to make life count, under the electric sky &lt;3\n\n\ntl;dr: You're all wonderful, I wish you the best.

I dropped this on socials but wanted to swing by here. You guys do a great job on this sub, and some may like an explanation. Frustrating situation...but I‚Äôve laid it out the best I can below. Have a great time in 2018!\n\nI need to address the errant confirmation regarding EDC and Bassnectar‚Äôs supposed appearance at the festival in 2018, but correct information regarding the Valentine‚Äôs Day release date. I am not looking to pass blame, but I want to share the facts of how this occurred maliciously. \n\nFirstly, sources are constantly vetted here and the nearly 100% track record of correct information supports that. Secondly, it‚Äôs been determined without a doubt that incorrect, misinformation was passed down to Festive Owl purposely. As some may or may not know, leaks come from all kinds of places and sometimes directly from events, artist or representatives of the event themselves. This can happen for a myriad of reasons, but using it as a form to communicate indirectly with fans, build hype for lineup releases etc is usually a key part of it. I was reached out to by someone with knowledge of all of the above. They wanted to get information out there to build anticipation for the early Valentine‚Äôs Day release date (which proved to be correct), and also shared photos of the heart candies that would be mailed out to fans the day of including those with Bassnectar printed on them. They asked not to leak the photos, but please bring the info to the fans. Normally, this is a win-win situation. You get accurate information early, and it also helps insure The Festive Owl‚Äôs credibility stays at the level expected. Fast forward three weeks down the line ‚Äî the Valentine‚Äôs release date is officially announced, but Bassnectar doesn‚Äôt appear on the lineup. The ‚Äúsources‚Äù official email is deleted and others reach out to confirm that misinformation was pushed deliberately from a fake \"marketing firm‚Äù. Believe it or not, not everyone in the world of live music likes what goes on here. What can you do...\n\nFinally, know that I am not happy about this either. I take this very seriously and know others rely on accurate information to plan ahead and more. The Festive Owl was started as a source of festival news, rumors + more for the fans by the fans. That‚Äôs what it still is all these years later. Like with most things in life, this is no longer worth dwelling over. Systems will be revised to avoid a situation like this ever again.

It seems instead of going with the acts that EDC is most famous for and are bigger names they chose to go with much newer acts that have only been around for the last 2-3 years. I'm pretty heartbroken that Galantis, even though they have a month-long opening in their tour schedule that falls right on EDC, is not playing (they are my GF's favorite band ever). Also, Dillon Francis will **FREAKING BE IN LAS VEGAS DURING THE FESTIVAL** but I guess isn't going to play EDC (my favorite by far). I'm excited to see Grum (long time fan) and Diplo (a unique experience for sure), but BOY HOWDY WAS THAT REVEAL A LETDOWN. Even no brainers like Chainsmokers (not a fan, but they are hot right now), DJ Snake, and Flosstradamus are going to be in Las Vegas EITHER THE WEEK DIRECTLY BEFORE OR AFTER EDC and are not playing. (That, to me, is the most infuriating, and perhaps indicates that Insomniac TURNED DOWN or ignored a bunch of artists this year for some reason or another.)       \n        \n      \nSo, rant over I guess. I gotta find new artists to get into. I gotta make this $1,000+ trip worth it, right?

Here's why I think this is true:\n\nSo Countdown released Deadmau5 and Porter Robinson as headliners well before the full lineup. I believe Bassnectar will be one of 3 headliners announced on Valentine's Day. Probably also Deadmau5 and someone else huge like Skrillex. (Don't quote me on that)\n\nThe main reason I think this is true is because Bassnectar was supposed to be the headliner of Middlelands every year and had a contract signed to come back multiple years. He announced it at Middlelands last May. But because there's no Middlelands this year (RIP pour some out) Bassnectar was moved by Insomniac to play EDC instead but he still wanted the headliner status (cuz you know it's Bassnectar) so they are gonna announce him early. \n\n\nTLDR: no Middlelands = Bassnectar at EDC + headliners early. \n\n\nEDIT: I also realize this isn't really anything new because the leak kinda said all this. I just wanted to give my own take on it.

I have more questions related to camping!**\n\nInsomniac put together their [camping guidelines](https://lasvegas.electricdaisycarnival.com/camp-edc/guidelines/) and [camping FAQ](https://lasvegas.electricdaisycarnival.com/camp-edc/faq/) pages related to camping and they are very informative. I'm not going to re-type all this information here, so use the links provided.\n\n**My wristband/parking pass/shuttle pass hasn't come yet!**\n\nBe patient, they are shipping out over 100k+ packages. You can also call Front Gate Tickets to see where your shipment is and/or set up will call pickup @ **888.512.7469**. Also here's the [Front Gate Tickets Support Site](http://support.frontgatetickets.com). \n\nIf you are coming from outside of the USA, you have no choice but to go to will call for your tickets. If you see no movement on your package and need to head to will call, here's that information (coming soon once it is released).\n\n**I have tickets/shuttle passes/parking passes to sell!**\n\nCheck out /r/EDCTickets or the [official ticket exchange](http://www.ticketsnow.com/seg134/resaleorder/edc-las-vegas-tickets/event/15481). Remember, even though our community is friendly, caring, and kind, there are ticket scammers out there that are willing to take advantage. \n\n**Tickets are still not sold out**, so you have to ask yourself if saving a few dollars is worth the chance of getting scammed! Be vigilant, if something seems to good to be true, it probably is. Trust your instincts.\n\n**Where can I register my Wristband? Do I have to register my wristband?**\n\n[You can register it here](http://insom.co/EDCLVwristband). The only way to recover your wristband if it is lost or stolen is to have it registered. Additionally, there is emergency contact information stored in your wristband as part of the registration process, if anything should happen to you. There is a $40 fee for a replacement wristband.\n\n**Well this is embarassing, I didn't listen to everyone and put my wristband on early/on the wrong hand, how can I get it off? I sold my wristband after I attended one of the nights, how can I get it off without damaging it?**\n\n[Here's a short how-to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcALJm9n5lA) to remove the wristband without damaging anything. **DON'T PUT YOUR WRISTBAND ON UNTIL FRIDAY BEFORE YOU LEAVE YOUR HOTEL!** It goes on your right wrist, and should be able to fit a finger underneath for breathing room.\n\n**I'm going solo to the fest, how can I make friends, I need a place to stay, etc.**\n\nThere are several ways of doing this. You can use the search function on the subreddit. There's also [some Facebook groups dedicated to solo journeys to EDC](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1528695257402603/). Once again, trust your instincts here and only stay with people that you can properly personally have vetted ahead of time. \n\nAlso, one of our mods made [this megathread post](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/7bv2il/roommatetentmatervmate_megathread_wanna_find/) for ride shares, hotel shares, and tent shares!\n\n**Live sets just aren't doing it for me, I need a feel for what this place is like before I attend!**\n\nCheck out [Under the Electric Sky on Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/70300667), or [The Electric Daisy Carnival Experience trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzSFZtRGeqs) from when the festival was still in L.A. If you can find The Electric Daisy Carnival Experience online for free somewhere or even for a couple bucks to stream it, I think it's a much better movie than the Under the Electric Sky movie.\n\n---\n\n##FAQ\n\n**When do the set times drop? When does the app update? I can't find the app on the app store, what gives?!**\n\nSet times and app updates usually happen the week of the festival. The Insomniac app will update soon, go ahead and install it now if you want to.\n\n**What about pool parties or other EDC Week events?**\n\n[Official site here](https://www.edcweek.com/) for a list of events and tickets. There's also going to be parties and pools at the campground.\n\n**What time should I leave the strip? How long does it take to get to/from to the speedway? What time should I leave the event to beat traffic?**\n\nEDC is not like a local DJ show and Las Vegas traffic SUCKS. Parking lots open at 2PM, so I would strive to leave the strip right around that time. Without traffic it will take you anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. The longer into the night you wait to leave the worse off traffic will be and the longer it will take to get to the show. I have heard nightmare scenarios of 2 or 3 hour shuttle rides, so don't let it happen to you!   \n   \nTypically, you can leave before the sunrise sets or about halfway through it and not have too bad of a wait in traffic back to the strip in the morning! At the end of night 3, keep in mind normal people are also heading to work since it will technically be Monday morning. That's just going to add to the clusterfuck of traffic on I-15 and Las Vegas Blvd. Plan accordingly! If you are driving have a cooler in the trunk with water bottles!\n\n**With all the terrorist attacks lately, what can I expect at EDC? Would it ever happen here, etc?**\n\nListen, the Speedway is right next door to a U.S. Air Force base and the event is 45 minutes into the desert and costs upwards of $400 to attend. That is a ton of work and a lot of hurdles for someone to go out there and do harm. Also, security will be checking that your wristbands are on before you are allowed into the lines to wait for the gates to open.   \n   \nThe Strip itself would be a better target if it were to even happen just due to the density of the crowd there. Expect a lot more cops than usual outside of the venue before you get inside! Don't let these people scare you from having a good time, that is the reason they are doing it, don't let them hinder our lives!\n\n**Do you know of any playlists that has all the artists music on it that are playing at EDC?**\n\n[For the past two years I've made Spotify playlists of the stages](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/68cu9i/edc_las_vegas_2017_artists_spotify_playlists_all/)! and I will do so again this year and post it whenever the 2018 lineup is dropped.\n\n**Are we doing the Reddit meetup again this year?**\n\nWe sure are. More information on the meetup coming soon.\n\n**What can I bring into the festival? What can't I bring into the festival? What are the searches like?**\n\nThe searches could be TSA style, or you could barely get touched at all. It's pretty random. Consider stash boxers or compression underwear to get your favors inside or items that are disallowed like LED gloves, etc. \n\nIf you take your time to observe the security, you can usually get a feel of who is being a hard-ass for a dime raise for busting someone and who is just doing their job quickly and efficiently.   \n   \nAs for allowed and disallowed items, [here's a link to those lists as well as totem guidelines.](https://lasvegas.electricdaisycarnival.com/guide/festival-guidelines/#acceptable-items)\n\nBring a gallon zip lock bag and put all of your belongings that you want to bring into the festival in it while you are waiting in line. All three days last year security complimented me on being organized and how easy I made their jobs because they could just scan the items in the bag, check my camelbak, give me the pat down and I was on my way. \n\nSeriously, if you make security's lives easier in this way, they will not hassle you at all as long as you aren't trying to bring in stuff that isn't allowed. I didn't even get pat down on Night 2 because I was so up-front about all my belongings.\n\n**Any further questions, feel free to comment below, or visit the [EDC Las Vegas Guide page](http://lasvegas.electricdaisycarnival.com/info/)!**\n\n---\n\n##Tips and Tricks!\n\n* Call your bank/credit card companies and let them know you will be traveling to Vegas to avoid holds on your account.\n* Be vigilant on the Strip. Everyone is trying to hustle. Street performers will expect tips if you take pictures!\n* Hit up a Vegas buffet at least one day.\n* Stretch beforehand in your hotel room. Your muscles will thank you in the morning!\n* Wear comfy shoes and/or get insoles to replace the \"stock\" insoles that come with your shoes. Also, consider moleskin if your feet are prone to blistering from rubbing against your socks. Your feet will thank you!\n* Get to the festival early. Stop by the merchandise tent first thing. Items sell out fast. Consider a mobile charging locker to store your merchandise in! Additionally, if you bring all of your sealed items in on the first day (wipes, chapstick, cigarettes, gum, tampons, etc), you can keep them all in your locker overnight and not have to worry about getting 3 of each sealed item to bring in every single day. **REMEMBER! Hide your lock from people that may peer over your shoulder or look at your combination wristband and try to get into your locker.** Remain vigilant inside the festival!\n* After you get your merch and put it in your locker, you next stop should be one of the four free water stands to fill up your hydration pack or water bottle. It's very important to remain hydrated, especially while the sun is still out and bearing down on you! If you tip some of the vendors, they will give you ice if the warm water turns you off.\n* If you need to eat something, consider the food trucks instead of the concession stand food. The food trucks have their company name out there and on the line when compared to the generic concession stand stuff, the quality of the food is unparalleled. Don't make the same mistake as I did last year and get a raw onion sandwich masked as a \"cheese steak\".\n* Bring earplugs! Tinnitus sucks!\n* Wear sunscreen! Remember, if you are staying all night the sun is up at like 5AM and starts beaming down on you almost immediately.\n* If you want to ride the rides, get there early or risk missing sets while standing in line! Some rides you will be waiting for an hour or more at peak times.\n* Time-stamp your texts! There will be cell service congestion. Stamping your texts will help your friends know whenever you truly sent a message!\n* Bring an external battery pack in with you to charge your phone if you are someone who likes to take a lot of photo and video!\n* Bring cash. Credit and debit cards could possibly be hit or miss if the speedway's internet network would happen to shit the bed! Don't be stuck without a way to pay for something you need!\n* Remember to take it easy night 1! EDC is a marathon not a sprint!\n* Emergen-C packets are a lifesaver. Take one before the festival every night in order to help you recover from the night before and prepare for the festival ahead!\n* Take some time to look up and enjoy the fireworks!\n* Don't forget about the EDC parade down Rainbow Road every night! You should at least try to check it out one time out of the three nights you are there!\n* Follow your favorite artists' social media so that you know if they may show up unannounced, or if they are doing any surprise sets on one of the art cars, etc.\n* Send a post card to back home at the EDC Town Post Office. Mine took until October to land, but it was a nice surprise when it finally did! Check out EDC Town in general. It's pretty sweet.\n* If you are feeling at all dehydrated or anything else medical related, visit one of the medical tents. Staff is super friendly and you WILL NOT get in trouble for seeking medical treatment, no matter your condition. If you can't make it to the medical tent, look for a Ground Control staff member to assist you or any of your friends! Look out for your fellow ravers. If you see something, say something! This will keep everyone safe and having a good time.\n* If you are going to do drugs, and especially MDMA, I suggest only doing it 1 out of the 3 nights and finding something else for the other two days. Just to let you know as an example of responsible use, in 2017 we did edibles and shatter the first night, rolled night 2, and just chilled with some shatter night 3. Everyone is different, but be safe, and TEST YOUR SHIT. Do not buy drugs at the festival. Not only do you risk getting bunk shit, but undercover cops are everywhere!\n* If you are going to drink alcohol, do so in moderation and stay hydrated! For every alcoholic drink you have, you should drink 8-16oz of water!\n* If you are a lady, bring wipes! Usually the porta-potties run out of toilet paper. It's just a fact of the festival and usually they don't get resupplied. You will thank me if you get caught in this situation.\n* Bring a hand fan for the water lines! They can get pretty hot and people will love you!\n* Try to catch at least one sunrise set one of the nights. I recommend night 2, since everyone and their mothers will be staying on night 3. Plus, Monday morning rush hour traffic on night 3 is no bueno.\n* If you have a large crew and need to split up to see different sets, plan a meeting spot! Try to pick something that is stationary, like the locker area, the cooling area, one of the buildings in EDC Town, etc.\n* Buy a smoothie or a lemonade. They are a nice change of pace from warm hydrant water.\n* Get a bandana and tie it around your neck for each night you are out there. Put it over your mouth and nose when the dust gets to be too much. Your lungs will thank you, plus you get to look like a bandit. Win/win.\n* Asian trains are going to happen, so use them to your advantage. Become the caboose to go into or out of the crowds and use your manners! Excuse me, thank you, etc go a long way when navigating the crowd!\n* Bring good vibes, leave the judgement at the gates, and most of all, enjoy yourself and smile! EDC is a glorious wonderland of fun. Extrude the vibes you with to receive back to you and you will have a great time, I promise!\n\n---\n\n##Let me know of any tip and tricks in the comments and I'll add them!","spoiler":false,"stickied":true,"subreddit":"electricdaisycarnival","subreddit_id":"t5_2srd1","subreddit_type":"public","thumbnail":"self","title":"EDC Las Vegas 2018 Tips, Tricks and FAQ","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/7rao3r/edc_las_vegas_2018_tips_tricks_and_faq/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"},{"author":"[deleted]","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"banned_by":"moderators","brand_safe":true,"can_mod_post":false,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1516123158,"domain":"self.electricdaisycarnival","full_link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/7qtts8/lineup/","id":"7qtts8","is_crosspostable":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"locked":false,"num_comments":1,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/7qtts8/lineup/","pinned":false,"retrieved_on":1516173881,"score":1,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"electricdaisycarnival","subreddit_id":"t5_2srd1","subreddit_type":"public","thumbnail":"default","title":"Lineup?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/7qtts8/lineup/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"},{"author":"Balbaugh92","author_flair_css_class":"daisy","author_flair_text":"29hguablaB","brand_safe":true,"can_mod_post":false,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1515777946,"domain":"self.electricdaisycarnival","full_link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/7py3vc/bold_and_baseless_predictions_thread_2018_edition/","id":"7py3vc","is_crosspostable":true,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"locked":false,"num_comments":21,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/7py3vc/bold_and_baseless_predictions_thread_2018_edition/","pinned":false,"retrieved_on":1515837242,"score":8,"selftext":"^Full ^disclosure: ^I ^stole ^this ^idea ^from ^another ^festival ^sub\n\nAs the title says, comment below with your totally outlandish and baseless predictions pertaining to EDCLV18.

Recent shows being Rezz, BOO SF, &amp; RL Grime. Next events are Boys Noize, (Maybe NGHTMRE cuz the additions are sick), Countdown, &amp; Excision!! My crew is slowly phasing out of the scene and this will be my first time driving down alone (hopefully not!). I've never met up w random ppl before but recently I've been going to a couple shows alone since I've always wanted to experience it and love meeting new people so it would be dope to drive down with others. My friend is brand new to the scene. Took him to his first festival a few months ago (HARD Summer) and he took his first molly and absolutely fell in love lmao. He wouldn't stop talking about it for like a month after. One of the best festivals I've ever been to and my whole group had an amazing time. I hope Countdown is even better!\n\n\nI'm big into bass music so this lineup is fire - some of the artists I'm seeing each day. Day 1: Alison W, Brohug, Dombresky, Funtcase, Monxx b2b p0gman, Porter, What So Not, Zeds Dead b2b Jauz.\n\nDay 2: Prob gonna be at the main stage most of the day cuz it's stacked af. deadmau5, Floss, GTA, Habby, Joyryde. Also NOISIA!! Datsik, Spag Heddy. Just to name a few.\n\nLooking for dope and chill people to ride down with (and come back up) and have space in our hotel (no couples sorry!) for people to stay.

I know the lineup is fire, but do the safety risks outweigh the amount of fun I would have at the festival? Any tips for someone who has never been to the country?

And how the issue of sunlight will be dealt with in the \"turnkey\" tents?**\n * *A: We have confirmed the third party company we will be using for shuttles and they provide transportation for the largest live events in the world. I am excited about collaborating with them to make it the best it‚Äôs ever been. Also, great camping question! The tents we are setting up will provide protection from sunlight. There are also multiple shade areas for not only activities around the campgrounds but also at the center camp, which is called The Mesa. We‚Äôll have more details about this when we announce camping soon!*\n* **Q: With camping being added and festival hours being extended, are there plans to change the re-entry policy?**\n * *A: Yes, during festival hours you can come in and out of the show as long as you have a camping wristband. We will have in's and out's at the festival for campers, but non-campers will not be able to enter the campgrounds.*\n* **Q: Can we get a ball park range for camping passes? Also will they be available in a payment plan as well? Lastly can we get an estimated time that they will go on sale?**\n * *A: It will be between $250-$275 to bring in your RV, and we‚Äôll have hook-ups available for an additional fee. As far as campers, there will be several different packages available. It depends how many people you‚Äôre with and what packages you choose, but you‚Äôll be able to get something between $450 to $2,500 for 4 days of camping. This will all be laid out clearly before we go on sale with camping options.*\n* **Q: You stated people who purchase tickets will have first chance at buying camping passes, does this apply to payment plans as well?**\n * *A: Yes.*\n* **Q: Will there be options for tents with air conditioning?**\n * *A: All tents will have air conditioning.*\n* **Q: Will it be possible to bring your personal tent and set-up(similar to Electric Forest) or only turnkey tents will be available?**\n * *A: In 2018 only turnkey tents will be available. We need to make sure that everyone has darkness and air conditioning and is comfortable. We're open to exploring something different in future years.*\n* **Q: How likely would it be to get a small stage, maybe even sponsored by like 7-Up again, inside of the huge shuttle tent outside the speedway?**\n * *A: We're capable of building that, no problem. No plans for that right now but I like the idea. Thanks for the suggestion! That said, we do not plan on having a long wait at shuttles with our new provider.*\n* **Q: Im a Cast Member at Disneyland and Ive seen you and Holly at the park often, how much inspiration from Disneyland goes into these festivals if any?**\n * *A: I get inspiration from so many different places. Even going all the way back to the original LA warehouse underground scene. But yes, theme parks as well!*\n* **Q: Does the new shuttle company plan on upping the amount of security monitoring these lines?**\n * *A: The answer to that question is yes. Shuttle operations are gonna be completely different next year.*\n* **Q: Was edc ny ended over low turnout, high cost, or a bit of both?**\n * *A: The reason we no longer organize EDC New York is because we felt like we needed to find a better venue.*\n* **Q: What was the first festival you ever attended?**\n * *A: Grateful Dead show in Southern California with Mama Irene.*\n* **Q: Are there any plans to update QuantumValley stage?**\n * *A: Yes, I'm excited to say that it‚Äôs going to be a new open-air stage.*\n* **Q: What about updating neonGARDEN?!**\n * *A: We are looking at doing a new design but it‚Äôs not confirmed yet.*\n* **Q: Will the livestreaming experience be improved for 2018?**\n * *A: I've gotten mixed opinions from people for what they'd like to see on this. I do appreciate your input. We're capable of doing longer sets. Maybe I should get a vote on this from fans.*\n* **Q: Pasquale will you improve premier parking for edc 2018?**\n * *A: The only way that we‚Äôll have it as an option is if it is 110% improved.*\n* **Q: Where do you lean on the pineapple on the pizza argument?**\n * *A: All toppings are welcome here :)*\n* **Q: Do you have any updates on a location for Middlelands?**\n * *A: We are still searching for the right venue and the plan is to definitely bring it back but not before finding the right place. Glad we crossed paths!*\n* **Q: Pasquale, I've always wondered this, what happens to the main stages after you're done using them. Where is Kinetic Cathedral for example. Scrapped for parts?**\n * *A: I have some artifacts in my backyard, there are some in the Insomniac warehouse, and we are looking to make an Insomniac Production Museum.*\n* **Q: Where exactly is the camping going to be on the speedway grounds?**\n * *A: Surrounding properties outside the Speedway grounds.*\n* **Q: Hey what is your favorite non insomniac festival and why? If it is burning man, what's your second favorite?**\n * *A: If you‚Äôre not letting me pick Burning Man, then I would say Boom Festival.*\n* **Q: Having a large quantity of DJ's at EDC is good for diversity but have you thought about lowering the amount of DJ's at the event in place of longer sets?**\n * *A: We will have artists periodically play extended set times depending on the genre or stage they are playing at.*\n* **Q: How safe is camping? Are personal items susceptible to stealing/looting while we're at the festival?**\n * *A: If you're in an RV I suggest you lock it. If you're staying in a tent, we ask that you bring your own lock as the zippers will have luggage lock holes. Security will be roaming the grounds as well. You'll be able to access your vehicle if you want to lock items in there too.*\n* **Q: Is there any plan to bring a megastructure stage back?**\n * *A: There are no plans right now, but there's the possibility of bringing the megastructure back, just not for the circuitGROUNDS. It's not big enough to accommodate the people at that stage.*\n* **Q: Will shuttle prices go up with this change? When will you announce shuttle stops? Can we expect to have the same ones as last year?**\n * *A: Not only are the prices not going up but shuttles will be immensely improved. All stops will be announced before the shuttles go on sale.*\n* **Q: Mr. Rotella, my question to you is, have you ever Kandiflipped?**\n * *A: Yes but I‚Äôve been sober for many years now*\n* **Q: After so many years of holding EDC in June, what was the final tipping point for you to move EDC to May? Moving forward, how much involvement do you think you will have with the HARD brand of events, and what is your vision for the Hard brand?**\n * *A: The biggest factor in our move to May was the cooler weather. It allows us to do camping, have extended hours, and the temperatures are way more comfortable for Headliners. It also takes if off of Father‚Äôs Day, which is great for me and all the other Dads. We‚Äôve owned HARD for 4 years but haven‚Äôt operated it, with the exception of helping with HARD Summer at Glen Helen this past August. Moving forward we‚Äôll continue with operations.*\n* **Q: Just wondering what the timeline for camping? What date could people check in and what is the latest they could check out?**\n * *A: Campers will definitely be able to check in on Thursday, but we're looking at the possibility of Wednesday. Checkout will be Monday around 7pm.*\n* **Q: Will we ever see stages relocated? Or since the system is already in place, will things forever stay the same?**\n * *A: We don‚Äôt have any plans to but if you think there‚Äôs a reason to, please let me know.*\n* **Q: Pasquale, I LOVE all the main stage designs, but can we please have more LED on the main stage?**\n * *A: We pretty much use all the LED in the United States for EDC Las Vegas every year so that might be difficult unless you own an LED company.*\n* **Q: In the campground can we get above ground pools and have pool parties with DJs?**\n * *A: That is being explored and likely to happen. Plus a lot more activities will happen. I'm excited about it.*\n* **Q: Are you going to continue this trend of booking artists that are not part of the EDM scene? (DJ khaled, metro boomin, etc.) A lot of headliners complained about being ripped off by the water vendors and being denied ice in 100¬∞ weather. Are you aware of this at all?**\n * *A: Thanks for supporting us for the past three years and reaching out to me today! For your first question, we'll always experiment with things out of the box. We are a dance music festival first and foremost, but we're gonna have fun sometimes, especially in Las Vegas, California. ;) As far as the water question, I never heard this before but thanks for bringing it to my attention. I'll speak to the head of F&amp;B at the Speedway. Good thing is the average temp in May is 64 at night. Thanks again. I'll get on this.*\n* **Q: I know at '17, there were some 'secret' tips and tricks of survival (including cooldown rooms, or earplugs available at medical). Are there any you would be willing to share with me about next year? I have heard that somewhere on the speedway, there is a tattoo booth that will tattoo the insomniac logo on you, is this true? How do you manage planning for unforeseen circumstances? For example, last year, traffic improved every day because you changed the system every day. Is there a council that brainstorms with you, or do you do it yourself? I know Green Velvet got 2 nights in '17 to perform; why is this? Not that I am complaining (I attended both), but why does this happen?**\n * *A: Okay, here we go. There are so many tips. You can find them on our website and in our festival guides. No secret tattoo booth at the Speedway in recent years, although we have had tattoo artists in vending booths before. I'm sure they'll tattoo anything on you that you ask for. I have an amazing team behind me here at Insomniac, and we troubleshoot in realtime during the festival. We also work with the city and the Speedway. Green Velvet played 2 sets because Joseph Capriati couldn't make it last minute. I was there for that second set and it was awesome.*\n* **Q: Have you ever considered a new event or stage at one of your current festivals dedicated to old school electronic music?**\n * *A: Fatboy Slim just played EDC Japan and Justice just played HARD Summer. Daft Punk could be their own festival! I love the old school vibes and sounds so we'll continue to bring some of them out more often.*\n* **Q: Can you make another film about EDC?**\n * *A: There's no plans now but we hope to make another film.*\n* **Q: I was wondering who exactly is Camp OG?**\n * *A: I used to throw warehouse parties called Insomniac every Friday in '93. Camp OG are a lot of the ravers that would support me in the early years, and still attend today. Insomniac would not exist without their support back in the day. They set up their own turn tables and renegade sound camps at our festivals. They DJ behind the decks and they play a lot of the early rave tunes from '89-'95.*\n* **Q: Improved cell service and wi-fi at the festival?**\n * *A: Cell service at EDC is difficult. We've tried improving it -- and we've made Wi-Fi available for free in Carnival Square -- but it's also nice to turn off for the weekend. Pro-tip: Always set up a meeting spot at the festival prior to entering.*\n* **Q: Any chance on bringing back the Circuit Grounds megastructure?**\n * *A: I love the megastructure but it could not handle the amount of people that wanted to be at circuitGROUNDS. We have to make sure that people have room to dance, we have a good flow, and it's safe.*\n* **Q: Hey Pasquale, what's going on with the Mexico on sale? Do you have plans to donate to those affected by the earthquake?**\n * *A: The on sale will be October 16/17 for EDC Mexico and will raise funds for those affected by the earthquake. The same goes for EDC Orlando for those affected by the hurricane. And it doesn‚Äôt stop there. All of our major festivals support communities in need.*\n* **Q: Are there any strategies you and your team are thinking up this year to cope with the trash problem?**\n * *A: Although our Headliners don‚Äôt always choose to Leave No Trace, at the end of the event, we never leave one. I do want to create incentives for people to clean up after themselves, as it puts out a positive message and beautifies the venue during event hours. But all trash is definitely picked up at EDC. The difference is that we do it rather than rely on the fans. I'd love for this to change.*\n* **Q: Will 2018 see this same mix of artists on the art cars, any plans for some new cars?**\n * *A: Yes and yes :)*\n* **Q: How long will Early Owl be available? I get paid Friday and friends are getting their monies next Tuesday. Someone wants to know why the ban on gloves and will it ever be lifted?**\n * *A: Early Owl will by sold out by Friday but you can get a layaway plan for less than $50 if that helps. I can't promise you anything about gloves but I'm always open to new ideas on how we can protect the culture and allow them.*\n* **Q: Can you have your team create 20ft tall electric misting towers and place multiple versions of them strategically smack dab in where the crowds cheer on their favorite djs?**\n * *A: I love how detailed your suggestion is. The average weather for this year's EDC is 64 degrees at night so not sure we'll need misters on this level even though we will have some in both the festival and the campgrounds.*\n* **Q: Can you get Elrow to host the Neon Garden one of the nights this year?**\n * *A: There's no plans but we'd be totally open to that.*\n* **Q: Were you aware that the VIP security lines this year were exponentially longer than the GA lines? Do you have any plans to change how VIP is delivered or is the whole point of VIP to give people that status and a few perks and nothing else?**\n * *A: This is the first I'm hearing of that. The VIP line is traditionally much faster than GA. If you ever experience issues like that I encourage you to reach out to me or Insomniac via social media. We can't fix it unless we know about it. The VIP experience has nothing to do with status. We provide services that are unique. To some people it's worth it, to some people it's not. We get repeat customers who don't like being in the mix, while others like the energy in the crowd outside VIP. That said, we like to improve so I'm gonna keep your notes. Thank you!*\n* **Q: Whatever happened to the giant daisy?!**\n * *A: It's in our Insomniac Warehouse but we should definitely dust it off and bring it out one of these days.*\n* **Q: Are there any plans to expand even more the EDC brand worldwide? We had spin-off editions in Brazil (2015), India (2016) and Japan (2017). Can these countries expect another edition soon?**\n * *A: Yeah we love spreading EDC around the globe. We feel it's a positive movement we want to share with the world. If we ever go somewhere and then stop, it doesn't mean that we're not coming back. We like to change things up by moving the experience around.*\n* **Q: Now that Gary Richards has left Hard Events are you going to take over?**\n * *A: Insomniac has owned HARD for 4 years now. We just didn't operate it. We helped behind the scenes with HARD Summer that took place at Glen Helen this past August. That will continue moving forward.*\n* **Q: is there anything overarching that you always look for when hiring? Have you ever considered bringing an event north of the border to Canada?**\n * *A: Passion, creativity, drive, loyalty, selflessness, and love for this culture and its history. We have considered bringing an event to Canada but nothing is confirmed right now.*\n* **Q: Pasquale, do you play Fantasy Football? If so, who are your top players on your roster?**\n * *A: I don't play Fantasy Football but I do play Galaga and Donkey Kong.*\n* **Q: What are your thoughts on DJ Khalid's performance at this past EDC?**\n * *A: It's a bummer when any artist's set is disrupted due to technical difficulties. He was not someone you would typically see at our events but it could have been fun had it worked out.*\n* **Q: Will EDC LV be going \"cashless\" and make the attendees utilize wristbands for payments in 2018 similar to other music festivals?**\n * *A: No plans for it right now but is that something you think we should do?*\n* **Q: Will Mandalay Bay be the location of the Premium Shuttles again in 2018?**\n * *A: There's a completely new plan for shuttles next year and that will be announced very shortly, before they go on sale.*\n* **Q: Is there any plans to expand the amount of time dnb is played at EDC?**\n * *A: I want to start off by saying I love you. I wish there were hundreds of you asking this question. Drum and bass is in my heart and soul. We've had DnB acts play more and more but the stages tend to empty out a bit, but we're gonna continue to push it because I'm a jungliest till I die!*\n* **Q: Are you planning on bringing more basscon stages to the bigger events like you did to Escape?**\n * *A: Basscon will host stages at several of our festivals throughout the year. It's not all planned out right now but we will be sure to continue giving the genre more and more love.*\n* **Q: Considering all the medical issues and circumstances that have occurred over the years at EDC and other Insomniac events, does Insomniac have a plan to improve medical tents or offer more AC areas for people to relax?**\n * *A: Insomniac does not face any different challenges than other festivals out there. I am so proud of our health &amp; safety team. We have some of the most innovative and best operations on the planet and I've traveled all over the world to festivals to get inspiration in this department. We will continue to come up with more ways to keep everyone who attends, happy and safe because we love every single person that comes through our doors. We also ask that people look out for one another. Self-responsibility is important.*\n* **Q: Do you think you could incorporate some fans or misting type machines to help keep things a-bit cooler in Neon Garden and Quantum Valley?**\n * *A: Even better, we've negotiated a deal with Mother Nature to decrease temperatures. But additionally, we are looking at both stages being open-air. ;)*\n* **Q: Out of all the festivals you have created, which one was your favorite to attend?**\n * *A: It's hard to pick because it's like choosing your favorite child. There are so many favorites. It's a tie between Nocturnal Wonderland at the Empire Polo Fields (we went until 6 AM!), the 20-year anniversary of EDC, Organic at Snow Summit in '96, or Middlelands. Oh, and the first year we did EDC at the LA Coliseum.*\n* **Q: Will you be re-designing ALL stages or just basspod,kinetic and wasteland?**\n * *A: We are exploring redesigning kineticFIELD, bassPOD, wasteLAND, neonGARDEN, circuitGROUNDS, and possibly the upside-downHOUSE. Look out for announcements to confirm what exactly we're gonna do.*\n* **Q: Two or three years back you said you would be writing a book / autobiography. Is that still something that is going to happen?**\n * *A: Yes, I'm working on it. It's not coming along as fast as I would like, but that's actually a good thing. So much has happened in the past year that I want to include. My main focus is producing events but it will eventually get done.*\n* **Q: With the absence of Mysteryland, I feel that an insomniac camping festival would be a huge hit in the Eastern United States, so, has it ever come across your mind?**\n * *A: Electric Forest is the only camping festival we have on the East Coast, but we're always looking to bring more!*\n* **Q: Can we have more diversity on the mainstage? Like the best of the best from each genre not just from the most popular genre?**\n * *A: Our attempt is to be diverse on kineticFIELD but if you and the users below don't feel there's enough of it, I'll focus on changing that. Thank you!*\n* **Q: You said that the people who first purchase their tickets will get access to camping passes first. Does that include someone on the payment plan?**\n * *A: Yes.*\n* **Q: Do you feel that you are currently fighting against an 'EDM Bubble' in the United States? We know you've seen the scene hit a slump before in the early 90's. If so, what's on your mind in terms of how you'll keep the energy going?**\n * *A: Dance music isn't going anywhere. It's always had times where it's more popular than other times, and in my eyes that's not a bad thing. It pushes artists to be even more innovative with their sound. But it doesn't matter how big or small it gets -- we're in this for life!*\n* **Q: Would you ever consider throwing an edc inspired cruise?**\n * *A: Yea an EDSEA has been considered many times. We will make it happen one of these days.*\n* **Q: With next year being the 25th anniversary of Insomniac, should we plan something special for the OG's from the first Friday night parties?**\n * *A: Yes, I definitely want to organize a 25-year celebration of Insomniac in a special way. I don't know what we're going to do yet but we'll definitely incorporate old school rave tunes.*\n* **Q: Pasquale will VIP include free alcohol?**\n * *A: No, VIP does not include free alcohol.*\n* **Q: How and why did you book Deadmau5 for Countdown this year? How did this come about? Can we expect some major lineup changes for EDC as well?**\n * *A: I don't have any problems with anyone in the industry. There's perceptions out there that just aren't accurate. I'm all about creating things at events that make the attendees happy. It's not about me. We're excited to have him, and I'm happy there has been a good response!*\n* **Q: Why wont you release all dj sets recorded at edc?**\n * *A: We leave that up to the artists to make that decision.*\n* **Q: Will quantumVALLEY be open-air next year?**\n * *A: Yes.*\n* **Q: Will you continue to bring the classic house to every EDC festival moving forward?**\n * *A: I always want to bring a little history to EDC. Let me know what suggestions you have!*\n* **Q: Does the RV need to be under your name or can you rent one from a third party?**\n * *A: I think what you're asking is can you bring in rented RV's and the answer is yes.*\n* **Q: Have you ever thought about throwing a one stage massive in the damus for Factory 93?? Will the factory on Naud st. Be used ever again?**\n * *A: There are no plans for that right now but NOS could work for a Factory 93 party. As for Naud St. no plans for that right now either but it's possible. We are working on new options.*\n* **Q: Why do you insist that us techno fans ‚Äúdon‚Äôt want more production‚Äù?**\n * *A: It's not about more production. It's about a certain style of production. Sound needs to be amazing. Visuals need to be amazing. There's a certain vibe that techno has and it doesn't always require confetti!*\n* **Q: Why did you chose edc lv on the week of finals?**\n * *A: I'm glad you asked. We did lots of research before picking the date and found that most colleges -- 85-90% -- are actually out. Of that 10 or 15% of students who do have their finals, most would have had their finals before EDC weekend.*\n* **Q: My question for you is if there has been talk about pushing EDC week events to the week following EDC rather than prior?**\n * *A: We are exploring both options for EDC Week. What does everyone think? The weekend before the festival or the weekend after, into Memorial Day Weekend?*\n* **Q: What's your favorite kind of weed?**\n * *A: Indica.*\n* **Q: What is Rainbow's opinion on EDC Las Vegas?**\n * *A: She says she wants to work with Papa when she's older.*\n* **Q: What‚Äôs it like mingling in the crowd during your events? Do you ever get tired of sweaty ravers touching you and asking for pictures?**\n * *A: I love meeting people and I love hearing what everyone thinks. I learn most from all of you and I've been a sweaty raver many times.*\n* **Q: In the industry, are radius clauses here to stay?**\n * *A: Radius clauses existed in the concert industry before I was born. They will probably exist after I'm gone. Despite what's been said, every body has them. You, the fans, don't want to see the same acts at every festival.*\n* **Q: Will White Wonderland ever come back?**\n * *A: It's great to hear that you enjoyed it. There's no plans right now but you're making me think I should bring it back. I'll keep it in mind and share it with the team!*\n* **Q: What are the odds of EDC returning to its original home, LA?**\n * *A: Anything is possible but no plans for that right now. Finding the right location is the challenge.*\n* **Q: Why doesn't Insomniac use urinal stations for guys rather than porta-potties?**\n * *A: I wish we had more access to those here in the States.*","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"electricdaisycarnival","subreddit_id":"t5_2srd1","thumbnail":"self","title":"Summary of Pasquale Rotella's AMA -- Questions &amp; Answers inside!","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/72wvwh/summary_of_pasquale_rotellas_ama_questions/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"},{"author":"Delayeddd","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":"NY-15, 16 | LV-16, 17","brand_safe":true,"can_mod_post":false,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1506004893,"domain":"self.electricdaisycarnival","full_link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/71jk93/any_edc_fam_going_to_lost_lands/","id":"71jk93","is_crosspostable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"locked":false,"num_comments":5,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/71jk93/any_edc_fam_going_to_lost_lands/","pinned":false,"retrieved_on":1506087866,"score":6,"selftext":"I have a feeling this is going to be an amazing festival with great vibes...and that lineup!\n\n\n\nHe's using the structure from life in color which looks crazy and outlined his sound design. 100 sub boxes (Basspod has 69).

Like the other guy posted, they're looking into a complete overhaul of the shuttle system. He said he's been hearing us loud and clear and he's satisfied with how EDC is inside the venue, but very unsatisfied with the experience getting there. He's had to delay because he does not want to announce anything before all the pieces are in place.\n\nOther things: I get the sense that insomniac lost money or underperformed last year. He was responding to a question about why nocturnal was being downsized and he implied they were saturating the market with festivals - \"quality not quant-\" but then stopped himself, and said he liked the idea of a \"boutique\" festival, and what better venue than Nocturnal.\n\nEDC line up not finalized till about 3-6 months from the festival date.\n\nEDC LV will always be dance music, though they're fine with artists bringing out hip hop acts. If any stage would have hip hop, it would be Cosmic Meadow because it's curated by Audiotistic and they have hip hop acts at their show. That being said, he doesn't think EDCLV will have hip hop as a lineup artist, for now.\n\nHe had no warning that Gary was leaving Hard but he emphasized more than once that it was for something he felt was a better opportunity. Also confirmed that Insomniac has owned Hard for the past few years, but let them operate on their own.\n\nAlso mentioned he'd love to have Skrillex there next year, so tweet him.\n\nEdit: Someone also suggested they do packages with certain hotels so that if you're staying there you have your own shuttle to the venue. He immediately said that to look for the transportation announcement in a few weeks. I'm thinking something like this will be incorporated into his plan.\n\nAlso, he said that it's not that the shuttle situation gets \"worse\" every year. They figure out their problems on any given year, but they fall behind in following through with those solutions the following year and the problem feels amplified (im assuming freeway construction and bigger crowds).\n\nDedicated plane packages (like tomorrowland) are out of the question because US airlines don't work like that. It's something that TomorrowWorld could not secure when they had their shows. That being said, he loves Tomorrowland, but prefers the American flavor of things.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"electricdaisycarnival","subreddit_id":"t5_2srd1","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"EDC Big Announcement in Two Weeks!","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/6rtegs/edc_big_announcement_in_two_weeks/","view_count":null},{"approved_at_utc":null,"author":"NiceLasers","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"brand_safe":true,"can_mod_post":false,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1501925868,"domain":"self.electricdaisycarnival","full_link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/6rqxbl/edc_lv_to_remain_one_weekend/","id":"6rqxbl","is_self":true,"is_video":false,"locked":false,"num_comments":59,"over_18":false,"permalink":"/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/6rqxbl/edc_lv_to_remain_one_weekend/","retrieved_on":1502310628,"score":44,"selftext":"I don't have proof, but Pasquale just said it while live streaming on Instagram.

Have an hour with nobody we cared much about, but don't feel like a break? Neon Garden. Just finished watching a set at Cosmic Meadow? Walk by Neon Garden, see what's up.\n\n**Friday night** slayed because of the Liebing/Moudaber facemelt. For those who don't know, they're like dark house, dancey but deep, dark, sexy vibes. Chris Liebing for 1:15, then Liebing b2b Moudaber for 1:00, then Nicole Moudaber for 1:15. Three and a half hours of sick. I also heard Christoph kicked ass that night, gonna have to check him out.\n\n**Saturday rolls around,** and after leaving Tommy Trash, on the way to Rufus Du Sol, we made sure to stop by Neon Garden. Who's this Nathan Barato guy? Idk, but he fucking slayed. Rufus ends, and we walk by and who's this? Oh shit, John Digweed is slaying. Should we check out Porter? Seen him a bunch and he's really good... but shit, Green Velvet is really kicking ass at Neon Garden.\n\n**Sunday time.** Catch Rezz at Circuit Grounds (amazing) and head right to Neon Garden. Oh, Dense & Pika just happen to be killing it. Wander around a bit, come back, oh shit, I'm stoked to see Alan Fitzpatrick and he's killin it too. Wander around some more and come back to find Adam Beyer throwin down... maybe our favorite set at that stage from the whole weekend. Kick ass. Oh wait, Green Velvet follows him up to close out?\n\nSeriously. Neon Garden was amazing. Great vibes, great dancing, great sound. Everyone was having fun and everyone was chill.

Also here's the [Front Gate Tickets Support Site](http://support.frontgatetickets.com). \n\nIf you are coming from outside of the USA, you have no choice but to go to will call for your tickets. If you see no movement on your package and need to head to will call, here's that information:\n\n**Mandalay Bay**   \n**South Convention Center, Bayside F**   \n**3950 S Las Vegas Blvd, Las Vegas, NV 89119**   \n   \n*Wed & Thurs: 2pm‚Äìmidnight*   \n*Friday: 11‚Äì3am*   \n*Saturday: 2pm‚Äì2am*   \n*Sunday: 2pm‚Äìmidnight*   \n\n**I have tickets/shuttle passes/parking passes to sell!**\n\nCheck out /r/EDCTickets or the [official ticket exchange](http://www.ticketsnow.com/seg134/resaleorder/edc-las-vegas-tickets/event/15481). Remember, even though our community is friendly, caring, and kind, there are ticket scammers out there that are willing to take advantage. \n\n**Tickets are still not sold out**, so you have to ask yourself if saving a few dollars is worth the chance of getting scammed! Be vigilant, if something seems to good to be true, it probably is. Trust your instincts.\n\n**Where can I register my Wristband? Do I have to register my wristband?**\n\n[You can register it here](http://insom.co/EDCLVwristband). The only way to recover your wristband if it is lost or stolen is to have it registered. Additionally, there is emergency contact information stored in your wristband as part of the registration process, if anything should happen to you. There is a $40 fee for a replacement wristband.\n\n**Well this is embarassing, I didn't listen to everyone and put my wristband on early/on the wrong hand, how can I get it off? I sold my wristband after I attended one of the nights, how can I get it off without damaging it?**\n\n[Here's a short how-to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcALJm9n5lA) to remove the wristband without damaging anything. **DON'T PUT YOUR WRISTBAND ON UNTIL FRIDAY BEFORE YOU LEAVE YOUR HOTEL!** It goes on your right wrist, and should be able to fit a finger underneath for breathing room.\n\n**I'm going solo to the fest, how can I make friends, I need a place to stay, etc.**\n\nThere are several ways of doing this. You can use the search function on the subreddit. There's also [some Facebook groups dedicated to solo journeys to EDC](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1528695257402603/). Once again, trust your instincts here and only stay with people that you can properly personally have vetted ahead of time. \n\nAlso, one of our mods made [this megathread post](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/6ejgtp/megathread_post_your_meet_ups_hotel_pregaming/) for meet ups, ride shares, hotel shares, and any other social activities!\n\nLastly, [here's a subreddit lodging sheet that someone started](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OwD5XIZ2Ah80rITBCnrt7UOmklu13IeVrIHPUft6jjI/edit#gid=0).\n\n**Live sets just aren't doing it for me, I need a feel for what this place is like before I attend!**\n\nCheck out [Under the Electric Sky on Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/70300667), or [The Electric Daisy Carnival Experience trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzSFZtRGeqs) from when the festival was still in L.A. If you can find The Electric Daisy Carnival Experience online for free somewhere or even for a couple bucks to stream it, I think it's a much better movie than the Under the Electric Sky movie.\n\n---\n\n#FAQ\n\n**When do the set times drop? When does the app update? I can't find the app on the app store, what gives?!**\n\nSet times and app updates usually happen the week of the festival. Currently, the Insomniac app is set to Middlelands still. It will update soon, go ahead and install it now to be prepared.\n\n**Do you have a handy list of DJs performing, on what days and on what stage?**\n\n[Sure do! I took this from a user on the Facebook group, and made a spreadsheet of my own](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LFVd-aS0JuRhC6YDKYudlJnxvpbcqa44u-KYDvUpuPc/edit?usp=sharing). I'll be adding the set times when they are released. The second tab is just my personal lineup of who I have targeted, feel free to ignore that, or make a copy of your own and alter the 2nd tab to your liking! \n\nOpen the sheet and go to File > Make a copy... Name it and then add it to your Google Drive to edit like I did! \n\n**Hey my favorite DJ isn't coming to the festival this year, which ones are like them?**\n\nUser /u/raatl started [this thread, that looks to answer just that](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/6df5ga/lets_have_a_hey_relectricdaisycarnival_i_like_dj/)!\n\n**What about pool parties or other EDC Week events?**\n\n[Official site here](http://lasvegas.electricdaisycarnival.com/edcweek/) for a list of events and tickets.\n\n**What time should I leave the strip? How long does it take to get to/from to the speedway? What time should I leave the event to beat traffic?**\n\nEDC is not like a local DJ show and Las Vegas traffic SUCKS. Parking lots open at 5PM, so I would strive to leave the strip right around that time. Without traffic it will take you anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. The longer into the night you wait to leave the worse off traffic will be and the longer it will take to get to the show. I have heard nightmare scenarios of 2 or 3 hour shuttle rides, so don't let it happen to you!   \n   \nTypically, you can leave before the sunrise sets or about halfway through it and not have too bad of a wait in traffic back to the strip in the morning! At the end of night 3, keep in mind normal people are also heading to work since it will technically be Monday morning. That's just going to add to the clusterfuck of traffic on I-15 and Las Vegas Blvd. Plan accordingly! If you are driving have a cooler in the trunk with water bottles!\n\n**With all the terrorist attacks lately, what can I expect at EDC? Would it ever happen here, etc?**\n\nListen, the Speedway is right next door to a U.S. Air Force base and the event is 45 minutes into the desert and costs upwards of $400 to attend. That is a ton of work and a lot of hurdles for someone to go out there and do harm. Also, security will be checking that your wristbands are on before you are allowed into the lines to wait for the gates to open.   \n   \nThe Strip itself would be a better target if it were to even happen just due to the density of the crowd there. Expect a lot more cops than usual outside of the venue before you get inside! Don't let these people scare you from having a good time, that is the reason they are doing it, don't let them hinder our lives!\n\n**Do you know of any playlists that has all the artists music on it that are playing at EDC?**\n\n[For the past two years I've made Spotify playlists of the stages](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/68cu9i/edc_las_vegas_2017_artists_spotify_playlists_all/)! Check them out and listen to some DJs you've never heard before!\n\n**Are we doing the Reddit meetup again this year?**\n\nWe sure are. [Check out /u/CzarCruise's post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/6eamdf/6th_annual_edc_reddit_meetup_information/)!\n\n**What can I bring into the festival? What can't I bring into the festival? What are the searches like?**\n\nThe searches could be TSA style, or you could barely get touched at all. It's pretty random. Consider stash boxers or compression underwear to get your favors inside or items that are disallowed like LED gloves, etc. \n\nIf you take your time to observe the security, you can usually get a feel of who is being a hard-ass for a dime raise for busting someone and who is just doing their job quickly and efficiently.   \n   \nAs for allowed and disallowed items, [here's an image of those things](http://i.imgur.com/0EEGVeP.png). Also, here's some [totem guidelines](http://i.imgur.com/xJvyd5J.png).\n\n**Any further questions, feel free to comment below, or visit the [EDC Las Vegas info page](http://lasvegas.electricdaisycarnival.com/info/)!**\n\n---\n\n#Tips and Tricks!\n\n* Call your bank/credit card companies and let them know you will be traveling to Vegas to avoid holds on your account.\n* Be vigilant on the Strip. Everyone is trying to hustle. Street performers will expect tips if you take pictures!\n* Hit up a Vegas buffet at least one day.\n* Stretch beforehand in your hotel room. Your muscles will thank you in the morning!\n* Wear comfy shoes and/or get insoles to replace the \"stock\" insoles that come with your shoes. Also, consider moleskin if your feet are prone to blistering from rubbing against your socks. Your feet will thank you!\n* Get to the festival early. Stop by the merchandise tent first thing. Items sell out fast. Consider a mobile charging locker to store your merchandise in! Additionally, if you bring all of your sealed items in on the first day (wipes, chapstick, cigarettes, gum, tampons, etc), you can keep them all in your locker overnight and not have to worry about getting 3 of each sealed item to bring in every single day. **REMEMBER! Hide your lock from people that may peer over your shoulder or look at your combination wristband and try to get into your locker.** Remain vigilant inside the festival!\n* After you get your merch and put it in your locker, you next stop should be one of the four free water stands to fill up your hydration pack or water bottle. It's very important to remain hydrated, especially while the sun is still out and bearing down on you! If you tip some of the vendors, they will give you ice if the warm water turns you off.\n* If you need to eat something, consider the food trucks instead of the concession stand food. The food trucks have their company name out there and on the line when compared to the generic concession stand stuff, the quality of the food is unparalleled. Don't make the same mistake as I did last year and get a raw onion sandwich masked as a \"cheese steak\".\n* Bring earplugs! Tinnitus sucks!\n* Wear sunscreen! Remember, if you are staying all night the sun is up at like 5AM and starts beaming down on you almost immediately.\n* If you want to ride the rides, get there early or risk missing sets while standing in line! Some rides you will be waiting for an hour or more at peak times.\n* Time-stamp your texts! There will be cell service congestion. Stamping your texts will help your friends know whenever you truly sent a message!\n* Bring an external battery pack in with you to charge your phone if you are someone who likes to take a lot of photo and video!\n* Bring cash. Credit and debit cards could possibly be hit or miss if the speedway's internet network would happen to shit the bed! Don't be stuck without a way to pay for something you need!\n* Remember to take it easy night 1! EDC is a marathon not a sprint!\n* Emergen-C packets are a lifesaver. Take one before the festival every night in order to help you recover from the night before and prepare for the festival ahead!\n* Take some time to look up and enjoy the fireworks!\n* Don't forget about the EDC parade down Rainbow Road every night! You should at least try to check it out one time out of the three nights you are there!\n* Follow your favorite artists' social media so that you know if they may show up unannounced (pls Kaskade), or if they are doing any surprise sets on one of the art cars, etc.\n* Send a post card to back home at the EDC Town Post Office. Mine didn't come through last year but I have heard of successful ones sending out! Check out EDC Town in general. It's pretty sweet.\n* If you are feeling at all dehydrated or anything else medical related, visit one of the medical tents. Staff is super friendly and you WILL NOT get in trouble for seeking medical treatment, no matter your condition. If you can't make it to the medical tent, look for a Ground Control staff member to assist you or any of your friends! Look out for your fellow ravers. If you see something, say something! This will keep everyone safe and having a good time.\n* If you are going to do drugs, and especially MDMA, I suggest only doing it 1 out of the 3 nights and finding something else for the other two days. Me and my crew plan on doing edibles the first night, rolling night 2, and just chilling with some shatter night 3. Everyone is different, but be safe, and TEST YOUR SHIT. Do not buy drugs at the festival. Not only do you risk getting bunk shit, but undercover cops are everywhere!\n* If you are going to drink alcohol, do so in moderation and stay hydrated! For every alcoholic drink you have, you should drink 8-16oz of water!\n* If you are a girl, bring wipes! Usually the porta-potties run out of toilet paper. It's just a fact of the festival and usually they don't get resupplied. You will thank me if you get caught in this situation.\n* Bring a hand fan for the water lines! They can get pretty hot and people will love you!\n* Try to catch at least one sunrise set one of the nights. I recommend night 2, since everyone and their mothers will be staying on night 3. Plus, Monday morning rush hour traffic on night 3.\n* If you have a large crew and need to split up to see different sets, plan a meeting spot! Try to pick something that is stationary, like the locker area, the cooling area, one of the buildings in EDC Town, etc.\n* Buy a smoothie or a lemonade. They are a nice change of pace from warm hydrant water.\n* Call your Dad on Father's Day before you head out for night 3!\n* Get a bandana and tie it around your neck for each night you are out there. Put it over your mouth and nose when the dust gets to be too much. Your lungs will thank you, plus you get to look like a bandit. Win/win.\n* Asian trains are going to happen, so use them to your advantage. Become the caboose to go into or out of the crowds and use your manners! Excuse me, thank you, etc go a long way when navigating the crowd!\n* Bring good vibes, leave the judgement at the gates, and most of all, enjoy yourself and smile! EDC is a glorious wonderland of fun. Extrude the vibes you with to receive back to you and you will have a great time, I promise!\n\n---\n\n##Let me know of any tip and tricks in the comments and I'll add them!\n\n#I can't wait to be under the electric sky with you all ~~in just~~ ~~12~~ ~~11~~ ~~10~~ ~~9~~ ~~8~~ ~~7~~ ~~6~~ ~~5~~ ~~4~~ ~~3~~ ~~2~~ ~~1~~ ~~more days~~ TONIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"electricdaisycarnival","subreddit_id":"t5_2srd1","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"EDC Las Vegas 2017 Tips, Tricks, and FAQ","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/6f61ni/edc_las_vegas_2017_tips_tricks_and_faq/","view_count":null},{"approved_at_utc":null,"author":"tittysprinkles333","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"brand_safe":true,"can_mod_post":false,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1496436754,"domain":"i.redd.it","full_link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/6ex3c8/what_is_an_art_car_if_luce_is_on_this_lineup_will/","id":"6ex3c8","is_self":false,"is_video":false,"locked":false,"num_comments":23,"over_18":false,"permalink":"/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/6ex3c8/what_is_an_art_car_if_luce_is_on_this_lineup_will/","post_hint":"image","preview":{"enabled":true,"images":[{"id":"UragjnOZSr9qvD7GWb1J4O2ewLcgbR09h0MipmtoEsU","resolutions":[{"height":192,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/ZslRQ-H9H8IoBcsIg6xz9D6nkO0d5fGsxFuQKRNIq5M.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=79275726d3b9737c4cb87bef77f5fbc1","width":108},{"height":384,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/ZslRQ-H9H8IoBcsIg6xz9D6nkO0d5fGsxFuQKRNIq5M.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=352ab188b9c3b1a4bd01051902689cd7","width":216},{"height":568,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/ZslRQ-H9H8IoBcsIg6xz9D6nkO0d5fGsxFuQKRNIq5M.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=a9dcde08b28b544d52053f1012aa151a","width":320},{"height":1137,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/ZslRQ-H9H8IoBcsIg6xz9D6nkO0d5fGsxFuQKRNIq5M.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=704b4c554aaf0ef14311fe6e17c663be","width":640},{"height":1706,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/ZslRQ-H9H8IoBcsIg6xz9D6nkO0d5fGsxFuQKRNIq5M.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=cdf86b63576590abce278374e77a31a3","width":960},{"height":1920,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/ZslRQ-H9H8IoBcsIg6xz9D6nkO0d5fGsxFuQKRNIq5M.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=1080&amp;s=a2d0d3c8636eb5f1f6e8ba8111e2f923","width":1080}],"source":{"height":2208,"url":"https://i.redditmedia.com/ZslRQ-H9H8IoBcsIg6xz9D6nkO0d5fGsxFuQKRNIq5M.jpg?s=57c73445346c33d1a053335a1db131ff","width":1242},"variants":{}}]},"retrieved_on":1500098204,"score":13,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"electricdaisycarnival","subreddit_id":"t5_2srd1","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Y-pwPEHVXXJBfcH6O2fByiv5K3DDdfMmRsgso2Tw9Sk.jpg","thumbnail_height":140,"thumbnail_width":140,"title":"What is an art car??

as I'm  from Australia aside from the Hardstyle festivals I attend all our festivals are throughout the day and evening so say 12pm-10pm. the headliners play last, the smaller acts play around gate opening times and then the rest of the bigger acts not headlining start playing around 5pm. With the Hardstyle events that go from like 9pm-6am usually the \"headliners\" play around 1-3am and then the heavy stuff which I'm there for in the first place; the raw and core play after that at the end, as they're more niche I suppose for the lack of a better term. \nAnyways now I have given my life story, what I'm trying to ask is - how do they structure the acts within Edc? Do all the headliners and big named acts play each day at the same time as one another? Or Are they spread out throughout the time slots? And what kind of artists from this years lineup would you expect to play at each point in the festival? I'm just really curious and trying to stabling establish how they structure the set times and if there will be major clashes etc. ( which with this Many artists is inevitable)  \n\nEdit: if you couldn't tell im Australian and flying over in 12 days for my first ever EDC and i can't contain the excitement!","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"electricdaisycarnival","subreddit_id":"t5_2srd1","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Set times structure","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/6egszg/set_times_structure/","view_count":null},{"author":"Caespino","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"brand_safe":true,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1496216166,"domain":"self.electricdaisycarnival","full_link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/6edfvo/artists_similar_to_duke_dumont/","id":"6edfvo","is_self":true,"is_video":false,"locked":false,"num_comments":6,"over_18":false,"permalink":"/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/6edfvo/artists_similar_to_duke_dumont/","retrieved_on":1497198230,"score":3,"selftext":"Can anyone make any recommendations for artists to see similar to Duke Dumont on the EDC lineup this year? :) ","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"electricdaisycarnival","subreddit_id":"t5_2srd1","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Artists Similar to Duke Dumont","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/6edfvo/artists_similar_to_duke_dumont/","view_count":null},{"author":"CarbonideLoL","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":"Your City (Hotel?) ‚ôÇ or ‚ôÄ","brand_safe":true,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1496197612,"domain":"self.electricdaisycarnival","full_link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/6ec248/linq_shuttle_pass_question/","id":"6ec248","is_self":true,"is_video":false,"locked":false,"num_comments":6,"over_18":false,"permalink":"/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/6ec248/linq_shuttle_pass_question/","retrieved_on":1497197550,"score":5,"selftext":"So I'm taking the LINQ shuttle and I have never used any shuttle system for EDC before.

WHY IS DJ KHALED added to the lineup? He's performs a lot, but he's barely a DJ, is considered a funny joke, talks too much, his coachella 2017 set wasn't impressive,  Is EDC in the beginning stages of being a sell out? Going away a bit from it's core root sounds.  Rave culture's edm music and diversity is made up of sub genres like big room, trance, hardstyle, techno, house, dubstep, drum n bass, future bass, trap, electro, edm pop (Calvin harris, Zedd, Chainsmokers, etc) etc. being some of the main ones.  Now they wanna throw in a little non-rave music artists like DJ Khaled & Metro Boom who are basically all rap, hiphip, R&B.  Metro Boom being a tiny bit of trap.  It's very bizarre and they don't belong at EDC.  What's next? More non-rave artists slowly slipping in the lineup, like rock bands like Metallica, Red hot chili peppers, Linkin park, Radio head? More trap, hiphop, rap R&B artists like Travis Scott, Gucci Maine, 2Chainz, Lil John, or radio pop stars like Britney spears, Miley Cyrus, Justin bieber, Lady Gaga, Beyonce? Billboard and radio top 100 mainstream artists.  \n\n¬†\n\nCuz they have massive fans and help sell more tickets, help it sell out sooner IF these names were added. Along with this would bring a big chunk of non-fans of rave culture.  But it's ODD and messes with the integrity and core sound of rave music.  This is the first year in vegas, it hasn't sold out as fast and expected.  Usually they brag about it selling out first, lineup gets released 2nd.  Not the case this year.  Some factors being the higher rising ticket prices, some say it's too expensive, lots of people are becoming more careful, frugal with their money want to save some, new nevada state entertainment tax, lots of hotels are starting to charge for parking, and several other factors to why it hasn't sold out this year fast as usual.  Maybe in the future, EDC will be 80% rave music subgenres, than 20% hiphip, rap, R&B, rock, pop, etc.? Seems like a possibility.  Maybe one day EDC Vegas, the largest music festival in North America in terms of attendance @ 135k+ people per day for 3 days will be a \"variety of genres\" festival like Coachella, Bonnaroo, and no longer just edm rave music.  Or they can add a stage just for them.  How other music festivals handle genres, give them their own stage.  Like how Coachella has the Sahara tent for edm music.\n\n¬†\n\nWanna hear from the veteran ravers who have been in the rave scene for 5-15+ years.

My main two are Eric Prydz, and Bassnectar. Based on who IS going, does anyone have recommendations on music/sets that would be closest to what these two play? I know Prydz is mainly prog house (I don't know any other artist on the lineup that's prog house though) but I have no clue what genre(s) bassnectar would be under---drum n bass? Dubstep?

Logo](http://www.edmsauce.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/edc-logo-electric-daisy-carnival-texas-youredm-edm.png) vs. [new logo (seen in top left corner of home page)](http://lasvegas.electricdaisycarnival.com/)\n\nI think there's a lot more significance to this than people realize.\n\nThe previous logo had that futuristic, I venture to say \"ravey\" sort of look to it. The new logo is noticeably simpler than the old one. It is a lot more neutral and doesn't make room for any assumptions about what sort of festival EDC is. What I think this means? BIG changes to a lot of things that may or may not include:\n\n\n**1)The lineup:** EDM is subsiding in popularity. Two years ago a lot of pop radio was EDM-infused. Think Zedd's 'True Colors' album and Calvin Harris' work from 'Motion'. Now EDM artists are moving towards the indie pop sound that hardly incorporates any elements of \"EDM\". Paris by The Chainsmokers is a great example of what the scene is moving towards. So expect EDC to cater the lineup towards fans of other genres like rap and rock.\n\n\n**2) The look of the festival:** I think with the explosion of EDM came a lot of money being poured into event companies like Insomniac, Ultra, and ID&T. With this sudden influx of budget came these massive, over the top festivals like EDC and Tomorrowland. I think with event sales being lower recently, spending room for EDC is gonna be lower. Expect a more \"back to basics\" sort of approach. No more neon everywhere, less crazy art installations, smaller Kinetic Field stage from now on. However, I'm sure Pasquale will still find a way to make it look magical as hell. After all, this is EDC, the Holy Mecca of American raving we're talking about here.\n\n\n**3) The experience:** This is more just the general vibe of the event that I am referring to. I expect the PLUR/kandi trading type people to have less of a presence at future EDC's. I imagine attendees will soon be more similar to the people attending Coachella or HARD.\nTake it as you will, but I think this signifies the end of an era. The \"EDM\" glory days are in the past. I think Insomniac sees this as the point where they need to start adapting with the times.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"electricdaisycarnival","subreddit_id":"t5_2srd1","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"My Thoughts On the EDC logo change...","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/67d273/my_thoughts_on_the_edc_logo_change/","view_count":null},{"author":"lafamilia23","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"brand_safe":true,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1493060479,"domain":"self.electricdaisycarnival","full_link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/67b5rt/is_it_just_me_or/","id":"67b5rt","is_self":true,"locked":false,"num_comments":52,"over_18":false,"permalink":"/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/67b5rt/is_it_just_me_or/","retrieved_on":1494630285,"score":89,"selftext":"is anyone else checking this page every 30 mins hoping to see new posts?!

I went to EDC in 2013, but haven't gone back since.\n\nWhen I went in 2013 I booked a shuttle pass, hotel, and scored tickets on craiglist at face value (in phx) a few weeks before the event.\n\nWe really want to see the lineup first. Been raving for 6 years and don't really want to go if the lineup consists of people we've seen multiple times. Based on last years lineup, thats not the case, but coachellas was so bad this year I can only anticipate the worse.\n\nI know the shuttles are essential. I see they are selling out. So first question is, if I just buy the passes, are they as easy to sell as the tickets??\n\nSecondly, when I went in 2013 the crowd was very pleasant. I felt like people there knew what they were doing and were respectful. I felt that was at coachella 2013 too. Coachella 2017 the crowd consists of kids in high school and freshmen in college who don't know the difference between bath salts and mdma, and end up eating grass like their a god damn cow (true story). \n\nHow is the crowd at edc now adays? Are you consistently getting shoved and pushed? Are people respectful? Are people the majority of the people there only there to say they went?\n\nAny insight on people who went a few years ago vs today would be greatly appreciated!!","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"electricdaisycarnival","subreddit_id":"t5_2srd1","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Haven't Been to EDC since 2013....
